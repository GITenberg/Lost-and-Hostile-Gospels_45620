        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is advisable,
        if not necessary, for me, by way of preface, to explain certain
        topics treated of in this book, which do not come under its title,
        and which, at first thought, may be taken to have but a remote
        connection with the ostensible subject of this treatise. These
        are:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The outbreak of
        Antinomianism which disfigured and distressed primitive
        Christianity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The opposition
        of the Nazarene Church to St. Paul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The structure
        and composition of the Synoptical Gospels.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The consideration
        of these curious and important topics has forced its way into these
        pages; for the first two throw great light on the history of those
        Gospels which have disappeared, and which it is not possible to
        reconstruct without a knowledge of the religious parties to which
        they belonged. And these parties were determined by the fundamental
        question of Law or No-law, as represented by the Petrine and
        ultra-Pauline Christians. And the third of these topics necessarily
        bound up with the consideration of the structure and origin of the
        Lost Gospels, as the reader will see if he <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> cares to follow me in the critical examination
        of their extant fragments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon each of these
        points a few preliminary words will not, I hope, come amiss, and may
        prevent misunderstanding.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The history of
        the Church, as the history of nations, is not to be read with
        prejudiced eyes, with penknife in hand to erase facts which fight
        against foregone conclusions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">English Churchmen
        have long gazed with love on the Primitive Church as the ideal of
        Christian perfection, the Eden wherein the first fathers of their
        faith walked blameless before God, and passionless towards each
        other. To doubt, to dissipate in any way this pleasant dream, may
        shock and pain certain gentle spirits. Alas! the fruit of the tree of
        γνῶσις, if it opens the eyes, saddens also and shames the heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">History, whether
        sacred or profane, hides her teaching from those who study her
        through coloured glasses. She only reveals truth to those who look
        through the cold clear medium of passionless inquiry, who seek the
        Truth without determining first the masquerade in which alone they
        will receive it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It exhibits a
        strange, a sad want of faith in Truth thus to constrain history to
        turn out facts according to order, to squeeze it through the sieve of
        prejudice. And what indeed is Truth in history but the voice of God
        instructing the world through the vices, follies, errors of the
        past?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A calm, patient
        spirit of inquiry is an attitude of the modern mind alone. To this
        mind History has made strange disclosures which she kept locked up
        through former ages. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg
        vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The
        world of Nature lay before the men of the past, but they could not,
        would not read it, save from left to right, or right to left, as
        their prejudices ran. The wise and learned had to cast aside their
        formulae, and sit meekly at the feet of Nature, as little children,
        before they learned her laws. Nor will History submit to hectoring.
        Only now is she unfolding the hidden truth in her ancient
        scrolls.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is too late to
        go back to conclusions of an uncritical age, though it was that of
        our fathers; the time for denying the facts revealed by careful
        criticism is passed away as truly as is the time for explaining the
        shadows in the moon by the story of the Sabbath-breaker and his
        faggot of sticks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And criticism has
        put a lens to our eyes, and disclosed to us on the shining, remote
        face of primitive Christianity rents and craters undreamt of in our
        old simplicity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That there was, in
        the breast of the new-born Church, an element of antinomianism, not
        latent, but in virulent activity, is a fact as capable of
        demonstration as any conclusion in a science which is not exact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the apostolic
        canonical writings we see the beginning of the trouble; the texture
        of the Gospels is tinged by it; the Epistles of Paul on one side, of
        Jude and Peter on the other, show it in energetic operation;
        ecclesiastical history reveals it in full flagrance a century
        later.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whence came the
        spark? what material ignited? These are questions that must be
        answered. We cannot point to the blaze in the sub-apostolic age, and
        protest that it was an instantaneous combustion, with no smouldering
        train leading up to it,—to the rank crop of weeds, and argue that
        they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name=
        "Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sprang from no seed.
        We shall have to look up the stream to the fountains whence the flood
        was poured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The existence of
        antinomianism in the Churches of Greece and Asia Minor, synchronizing
        with their foundation, transpires from the Epistles of St. Paul. It
        was an open sore in the life-time of the Twelve; it was a sorrow
        weighing daily on the great soul of the Apostle of the Gentiles. It
        called forth the indignant thunder of Jude and Peter, and the awful
        denunciations in the charges to the Seven Churches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apocryphal
        literature of the sub-apostolic period carries on the sad story.
        Under St. John's presiding care, the gross scandals which defiled
        Gentile Christianity were purged out, and antinomian Christianity
        deserted Asia Minor for Alexandria. There it made head again, as
        revealed to us by the controversialists of the third century. And
        there it disappeared for a while.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the disease
        was never eradicated. Its poison still lurked in the veins of the
        Church, and again and again throughout the Middle Ages heretics
        emerged fitfully, true successors of Nicolas, Cerdo, Marcion and
        Valentine, shaking off the trammels of the moral law, and seeking
        justification through mystic exaltation or spiritual emotion. The
        Papacy trod down these ugly heretics with ruthless heel. But at the
        Reformation, when the restraint was removed, the disease broke forth
        in a multitude of obscene sects spotting the fair face of
        Protestantism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor has the virus
        exhausted itself. Its baleful workings, if indistinct, are still
        present and threatening.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But how comes it
        that Christianity has thus its dark <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> shadow constantly haunting it? The cause is to
        be sought in the constitution of man. Man, moving in his little
        orbit, has ever a face turned away from the earth and all that is
        material, looking out into infinity,—a dark, unknown side, about
        whose complexion we may speculate, but which we can never map. It is
        a face which must ever remain mysterious, and ever radiate into
        mystery. As the eye and ear are bundles of nerves through which the
        inner man goes out into, and receives impressions from, the material
        world, so is the soul a marvellous tissue of fibres through which man
        is placed <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">en rapport</span></span> with the spiritual
        world, God and infinity. It is the existence of this face, these
        fibres—take which simile you like—which has constituted mystics in
        every age all over the world: Schamans in frozen Siberia, Fakirs in
        burning India, absorbed Buddhists, ecstatic Saints, Essenes, Witches,
        Anchorites, Swedenborgians, modern Spiritualists.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man, double-faced
        by nature, is placed by Revelation under a sharp, precise external
        rule, controlling his actions and his thoughts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this rule
        spirit and body are summoned to do homage. But the spirit has an
        inherent tendency towards the unlimited, by virtue of its nature,
        which places it on the confines of the infinite. Consequently it is
        never easy under a rule which is imposed on it conjointly with the
        body; it strains after emancipation, strives to assert its
        independence of what is external, and to establish its claim to obey
        only the movements in the spiritual world. It throbs sympathetically
        with the auroral flashes in that realm of mystery, like the flake of
        gold-leaf in the magnetometer.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To be bound to the
        body, subjected to its laws, is degrading; to be unbounded,
        unconditioned, is its aspiration and supreme felicity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the incessant
        effort of the spirit is to establish its law in the inner world of
        feeling, and remove it from the material world without.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, inasmuch
        as the spirit melts into the infinite, cut off from it by no
        sharply-defined line, it is disposed to regard itself as a part of
        God, a creek of the great Ocean of Divinity, and to suppose that all
        its emotions are the pulsations of the tide in the all-embracing
        Spirit. It loses the consciousness of its individuality; it deifies
        itself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Suffee fable
        representing God and the human soul illustrates this well.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“One knocked at the Beloved's door, and a
        voice from within cried, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Who is
        there?’</span> Then the soul answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is
        I.’</span> And the voice of God said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘This
        house will not hold me and thee.’</span> So the door remained shut.
        Then the soul went away into a wilderness, and after long fasting and
        prayer it returned, and knocked once again at the door. And again the
        voice demanded <span class="tei tei-q">‘Who is there?’</span> Then he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Thou</span></span>,’</span> and at once
        the door opened to him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the mystic
        always regards his unregulated wishes as divine revelations, his
        random impulses as heavenly inspirations. He has no law but his own
        will; and therefore, in mysticism, there, is no curb against the
        grossest licence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The existence of
        that evil which, knowing the constitution of man, we should expect to
        find prevalent in mysticism, the experience of all ages has shown
        following, dogging its steps <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg
        xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        inevitably. So slight is the film that separates religious from
        sensual passion, that uncontrolled spiritual fervour roars readily
        into a blaze of licentiousness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is this which
        makes revivalism of every description so dangerous. It is a two-edged
        weapon that cuts the hand which holds it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the spiritual,
        religious element in man is that which is most beautiful and pure,
        when passionless. It is like those placid tarns, crystal clear and
        icy cold, in Auvergne and the Eifel, which lie in the sleeping vents
        of old volcanoes. We love to linger by them, yet never with security,
        for we know that a throb, a shock, may at any moment convert them
        into boiling geysirs or raging craters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So well is this
        fact known in the Roman Church, that a mystic is inexorably shut up
        in a convent, or cast out as a heretic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more spiritual
        a religion is, the more apt it is to lurch and let in a rush of
        immorality; for its tendency is to substitute an internal for the
        external law, and the internal impulse is too often a hidden jog from
        the carnal appetite. In a highly spiritual religion, a written
        revelation is supplemented or superseded by one which is within.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was eminently
        the case with the Anabaptists of the sixteenth century. When plied
        with texts by the Lutheran divines, they coldly answered that they
        walked not after the letter, but after the spirit; that to those who
        are in Christ Jesus, there is an inner illumination directing their
        conduct, before which that which is without grew pale and waned. The
        horrible <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg
        xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        licence into which this internal light plunged them is matter of
        history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One lesson history
        enforces inexorably—that there lies a danger to morals in placing
        reliance on the spirit as an independent guide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spirit has its
        proper function and its true security; its function, the perception
        of the infinite, the divine; its security, the observance of the
        marriage-tie which binds it to the body.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God has joined
        body and spirit in sacred wedlock, and subjected both to a revealed
        external law; in the maintenance of this union, and submission to
        this law, man's safety lies. The spirit supreme, the body a
        bond-maid, is no marriage; it is a concubinage, bringing with it a
        train of attendant evils.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man stands, so to
        speak, at the bisection of two circles, the material and the
        spiritual, in each of which he has a part, and to the centres of each
        of which he feels a gravitation. Absorption in either realm is fatal
        to the well-being of the entire man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And this leads us
        to the consideration of the marvellous aptitude to human nature of
        the Incarnation, welding together into indissoluble union spirit and
        matter, the infinite and the finite. The religion which flows from
        that source cannot dissociate soul from body. Its law is the marriage
        of that which is spiritual to that which is material; the soul cannot
        shake off the responsibilities of the body; everything spiritual is
        clothed, and every material object is a sacrament conveying a ray of
        divinity.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg
        xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can be no
        evasion, no abrasion and rupture of the tie by either party, without
        lesion of the chain which binds to the Incarnation; and it is a fact
        worthy of note, that mysticism has always a tendency to obscure this
        fundamental dogma, and that the immoral sects of ancient times and of
        the present day hang loosely by, or openly deny, this great
        verity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Paul had a
        natural bias towards mysticism. His trances and revelations betoken a
        nature branching out into the spiritual realm; and throughout his
        letters we see the inevitable consequence—a struggle to displace the
        centre of obedience, to transfer it from without and enthrone it
        within, to make the internal revelation the governing principle of
        action, in the room of submission to an external law.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, like St.
        Theresa, who never relinquished her common sense whilst yielding up
        her spirit to the most incoherent raptures; like Mohammad, who,
        however he might soar in ecstasy above the moon, never lost sight of
        the principles which would ensure a very material success; like
        Ignatius Loyola, who, in the midst of fantastic visions, elaborated a
        system of government full of the maturest judgment,—so St. Paul never
        surrendered himself unconditionally to the promptings of his spirit.
        Like the angel of the Apocalypse, if he stood with one foot in the
        vague sea, he kept the other on the solid land.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That thorn in the
        flesh, whose presence he deplored, kept him from forgetting the body
        and its obligations; the moral disorders breaking out wherever he
        preached his gospel, warned him in time not to relax too far the
        restraint imposed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg
        xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        the law without. As the revolt of the Anabaptists checked Luther, so
        did the excesses of the Gentile Christians arrest Paul. Both saw and
        obeyed the warning finger of Providence signalling a retreat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Divinely inspired
        St. Paul was. But inspiration never obscures and obliterates human
        characteristics. It directs and utilizes them for its own purpose,
        leaving free margin beyond that purpose for the exercise of
        individual proclivities uncontrolled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Paul's natural
        tendency is unmistakable; and we may see evidence of divine guidance
        in the fact of his having refused to give the rein to his natural
        propensities, and of being prepared to turn all his energies to the
        repairing of those dykes against the ocean which in a moment of
        impatience he had set his hand to tear down.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Socrates was by
        nature prone to become the most vicious of men, so was Paul naturally
        disposed to become the most dangerous of heresiarchs. But the moral
        sense of Socrates mastered his passions and converted him into a
        philosopher; and the guiding spirit of God made of Paul the mystic an
        apostle of righteousness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christianity, as
        the religion of the Incarnation, has its external form and its
        internal spirit, and it is impossible to dissociate one from the
        other without peril. Mere formalism and naked spirituality are alike
        and equally pernicious. Formalism, the resolution of religion into
        ceremonial acts only, void of spirit, is like the octopus, lacing its
        thousand filaments about the soul and drawing it into the abyss; and
        mysticism, pure spirituality, like the magnet mountain in Sinbad's
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id=
        "Pgxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> voyage, draws the nails out of the
        vessel—the rivets of moral law—and the Christian character goes to
        pieces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of the
        Church is the history of her leaning first towards one side, then
        towards the other, of advance amid perpetual recoils from either
        peril.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The alarm
        caused in Jerusalem amidst the elder apostles and the Nazarene Church
        at the immorality which disfigured Pauline Christianity, was not the
        only cause of the mistrust wherewith they viewed him and his
        teaching. Other causes existed which I have not touched on in my
        text, lest I should distract attention from the main points of my
        argument, but they are deserving of notice here.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the first of
        these was the intense prejudice which existed among the Jews of
        Palestine against Greek modes of thought, manners, culture, even
        against the Greek language.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second was the
        jealousy with which the Palestinian Jews regarded the Alexandrine
        Jews, their mode of interpreting Scripture, and their system of
        theology.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Paul, an
        accomplished Greek scholar, brought up at Tarsus amidst Hellenistic
        Jews, adopted the theology and exegesis in vogue at Alexandria, and
        on both these accounts excited the suspicion and dislike of the
        national party at Jerusalem. The Nazarenes were imbued with the
        prejudices they had acquired in their childhood, in the midst of
        which they had grown up, and they could not but regard Paul with
        alarm when he turned without disguise to the Greeks, and introduced
        into the Church the theological system and scriptural interpretations
        of a Jewish community they had always regarded as of questionable
        orthodoxy.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvi">[pg
        xvi]</span><a name="Pgxvi" id="Pgxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First let us
        consider the causes which contributed to the creation of the
        prejudice against the Hellenizers. Judaea had served as the
        battle-field of the Greek kings of Egypt and Syria. Whether Judaea
        fell under the dominion of Syria or Egypt it mattered not; Ptolemies
        and Seleucides alike were intolerable oppressors. But it was
        especially the latter who excited to its last exasperation the
        fanaticism of the Jews, and called forth in their breasts an
        ineffaceable antipathy towards everything that was Greek.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temple was
        pillaged by them, the sanctuary was violated, the high-priesthood
        degraded. Antiochus Epiphanes entertained the audacious design of
        completely overthrowing the religion of the Jews, of forcibly
        Hellenizing them. For this purpose he forbade the celebration of the
        Sabbaths and feasts, drenched the sanctuary with blood to pollute it,
        the sacrifices were not permitted, circumcision was made illegal. The
        sufferings of the Jews, driven into deserts and remote hiding-places
        in the mountains, are described in the first book of the
        Maccabees.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet there was a
        party disposed to acquiesce in this attempt at changing the whole
        current of their nation's life, ready to undo the work of Ezra, break
        with their past, and fling themselves into the tide of Greek
        civilization and philosophic thought. These men set up a gymnasium in
        Jerusalem, Graecised their names, openly scoffed at the Law, ignored
        the Sabbath, and neglected circumcision.<a id="noteref_1" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The memory of the
        miseries endured in the persecution of Antiochus did not fade out of
        the Jewish mind, neither did the party disappear which was disposed
        to symbolize with Greek culture, and was opposed to Jewish prejudice.
        Nor did the abhorrence in which it was held lose its intensity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the date of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seventy years
        before Christ, whilst Hyrcanus was besieging Aristobulus in
        Jerusalem, the besiegers furnished the besieged daily with lambs for
        the sacrifice. An old Jew, belonging to the anti-national party,
        warned Hyrcanus that as long as the city was supplied with animals
        for the altar, so long it would hold out. On the morrow, in place of
        a lamb, a pig was flung over the walls. The earth shuddered at the
        impiety, and the heads of the synagogue solemnly cursed from
        thenceforth whosoever of their nation should for the future teach the
        Greek tongue to his sons.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=

        this incident be true or not, it proves that a century after

        impiety.</p>

        and substitution for it of the Lord's-day, his denunciation of
        circumcision, his abandonment of his Jewish name for a Gentile one,
        led to his being identified by the Jews of Palestine with the
        abhorred Hellenistic party; and the Nazarene Christians shared to the
        full in the national prejudices.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jews, at the
        time of the first spread of Christianity, were dispersed over the
        whole world; and in Greece and Asia Minor occupied a quarter, and
        exercised influence, in every town. The Seleucides had given the
        right of citizenship to these Asiatic Jews, and had extended to them
        some sort of protection. The close association of these Jews with
        Greeks necessarily led to the adoption of some of their ideas. Since
        Ezra, the dominant principle of the Palestinian and Babylonish rabbis
        had been to create a <span class="tei tei-q">“hedge of the
        Law,”</span> to constitute of the legal prescriptions a net lacing
        those over whom it was cast with minute yet tough fibres, stifling
        spontaneity. Whilst rabbinism was narrowing the Jewish horizon, Greek
        philosophy was widening man's range of vision. The tendencies of
        Jewish theology and Greek philosophy were radically opposed. The
        Alexandrine Jews never submitted to be involved in the meshes of
        rabbinism. They produced a school of thinkers, of whom Aristobulus
        was the first known exponent, and Philo the last expression, which
        sought to combine Mosaism with Platonism, to explain the Pentateuch
        as the foundation of a philosophic system closely related to the
        highest and best theories of the Greeks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Holy Land,
        routine, the uniform repetition of prescribed forms, the absence of
        all alien currents of thought, tended insensibly to transform
        religion into formalism, and to identify it with the ceremonies which
        are its exterior manifestation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Egypt, on the
        other hand, the Alexandrine Jews, ambitious to give to the Greeks an
        exalted idea of their religion, strove to bring into prominence its
        great doctrines of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg
        xx]</span><a name="Pgxx" id="Pgxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Unity
        of the Godhead, of Creation, and Providence. All secondary points
        were allegorized or slurred over. As Palestinian rabbinism became
        essentially ceremonial, Alexandrine Judaism became essentially
        spiritual. The streams of life and thought in these members of the
        same race were diametrically opposed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jews settled
        in Asia Minor, subjected to the same influences, actuated by the same
        motives, as the Egyptian Jews, looked to Alexandria rather than to
        Jerusalem or Babylon for guidance, and were consequently involved in
        the same jealous dislike which fell on the Jews of Egypt.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can be no
        doubt that St. Paul was acquainted with, and influenced by, the views
        of the Alexandrine school. That he had read some of Philo's works is
        more than probable. How much he drew from the writings of Aristobulus
        the Peripatetic cannot be told, as none of the books of that learned
        but eclectic Jew have been preserved.<a id="noteref_8" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In more than one
        point Paul departs from the traditional methods of the Palestinian
        rabbis, to adopt those of the Alexandrines. The Jews of Palestine did
        not admit the allegorical interpretation of Scripture. Paul, on two
        occasions, follows the Hellenistic mode of allegorizing the sacred
        text. On one of these occasions he uses an allegory of Philo, while
        slightly varying its application.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what is far
        more remarkable is to find in Philo, born between thirty and forty
        years before Christ, the key to most of Paul's theology,—the
        doctrines of the all-sufficiency of faith, of the worthlessness of
        good works, of the imputation of righteousness, of grace, mediation,
        atonement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in Philo,
        these doctrines drift purposeless. Paul took them and applied them to
        Christ, and at once they fell into their ranks and places. What was
        in suspension in Philo, crystallized in Paul. What the Baptist was to
        the Judaean Jews, that Philo was to the Hellenistic Jews; his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Fathers,
        perplexed at finding Pauline words, expressions, ideas, in the
        writings of Philo, and unwilling to admit that Paul had derived them
        from Philo, invented a myth that the Alexandrine Jew came to Rome and
        was there converted to the Christian faith. Chronology and a critical

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that Paul
        was deeply saturated with the philosophy of the Alexandrine Jews has
        given rise also to two <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxii">[pg
        xxii]</span><a name="Pgxxii" id="Pgxxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        obstinate Christian legends,—that Dionysius the Areopagite, author of
        the Celestial Hierarchy, the Divine Names, &amp;c., was the disciple
        of St. Paul, and that Seneca the philosopher was also his convert and
        pupil. Dionysius took Philo's system of the universe and emanations
        from the Godhead and Christianized them. The influence of Philo on
        the system of Dionysius <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">saute aux
        yeux</span></span>, as the French would say. And Dionysius protests,
        again and again, in his writings that he learned his doctrine from
        St. Paul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From a very early
        age, the Fathers insisted on Seneca having been a convert of St.
        Paul; they pointed out the striking analogies in their writings, the
        similarity in their thoughts. How was this explicable unless one had
        been the pupil of the other? But Seneca, we know, lived some time in
        Alexandria with his uncle, Severus, prefect of Egypt; and at that
        time the young Roman, there can be little question, became acquainted
        with the writings of Philo.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=

        adopting the mode of Biblical interpretation of a rival school to
        that dominant in Judaea, by absorbing its philosophy, applying it to
        the person of Christ and the moral governance of the Church, by
        associating with Asiatic Jews, known to be infected with Greek
        philosophic heresies, and by his open invocation to the Gentiles to
        come into and share in all the plenitude of the privileges of the
        gospel, incurred the suspicion, distrust, dislike of the believers in
        Jerusalem, who had grown up in the midst of national prejudices which
        Paul shocked.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiii">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. It has been
        argued with much plausibility, that because certain of the primitive
        Fathers were unacquainted with the four Gospels now accounted
        Canonical, that therefore those Gospels are compositions subsequent
        to their date, and that therefore also their authority as testimonies
        to the acts and sayings of Jesus is sensibly weakened, if not wholly
        overthrown. It is true that there were certain Fathers of the first
        two centuries who were unacquainted with our Gospels, but the above
        conclusions drawn from this fact are unsound.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This treatise
        will, I hope, establish the fact that at the close of the first
        century almost every Church had its own Gospel, with which alone it
        was acquainted. But it does not follow that these Gospels were not as
        trustworthy, as genuine records, as the four which we now alone
        recognize.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is possible,
        from what has been preserved of some of these lost Gospels, to form
        an estimate of their scope and character. We find that they bore a
        very close resemblance to the extant Synoptical Gospels, though they
        were by no means identical with them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find that they
        contained most of what exists in our three first Evangels, in exactly
        the same words; but that some were fuller, others less complete, than
        the accepted Synoptics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we discover
        whole paragraphs absolutely identical in the Gospels of Matthew,
        Mark, Luke, of the Hebrews, of the Clementines, of the Lord, it goes
        far to prove that all the Evangelists drew upon a common fund. And if
        we see that, though using the same material, they arranged it
        differently, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiv">[pg
        xxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxiv" id="Pgxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        we are forced to the conclusion that this material they incorporated
        in their biographies existed in <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">anecdota</span></span>, not in a consecutive
        narrative.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some, at least, of
        the Gospels were in existence at the close of the first century; but
        the documents of which they were composed were then old and
        accepted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And though it is
        indisputable that in the second century the Four had not acquired
        that supremacy which brought about the disappearance of the other
        Gospels, and were therefore not quoted by the Fathers in preference
        to them, it is also certain that all the material out of which both
        the extant and the lost Synoptics were composed was then in
        existence, and was received in the Church as true and canonical.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Admitting fully
        the force of modern Biblical criticism, I cannot admit all its most
        sweeping conclusions, for they are often, I think, more sweeping than
        just.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The material out
        of which all the Synoptical Gospels, extant or, lost, were composed,
        was in existence and in circulation in the Churches in the first
        century. That material is—the sayings of Christ on various occasions,
        and the incidents in his life. These sayings and doings of the Lord,
        I see no reason to doubt, were written down from the mouths of
        apostles and eye-witnesses, in order that the teaching and example of
        Christ might be read to believers in every Church during the
        celebration of the Eucharist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The early Church
        followed with remarkable fidelity the customs of the Essenes, so
        faithfully that, as I have shown, Josephus mistook the Nazarenes for
        members of the Essene <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxv">[pg
        xxv]</span><a name="Pgxxv" id="Pgxxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        sect; and in the third century Eusebius was convinced that the
        Therapeutae, their Egyptian counterparts, were actually primitive
        Christians.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Essenes
        assembled on the Sabbath for a solemn feast, in white robes, and,
        with faces turned to the East, sang antiphonal hymns, broke bread and
        drank together of the cup of love. During this solemn celebration the
        president read portions from the sacred Scriptures, and the
        exhortations of the elders. At the Christian Eucharist the ceremonial
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a name=

        description of a Christian assembly might be a paragraph from
        Josephus or Philo describing an Essene or Therapeutic celebration. In
        place of the record of the wanderings of the Israelites and the wars
        of their kings being read at their conventions, the president read
        the journeys of the Lord, his discourses and miracles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner was a
        Church founded by an apostle than there rose a demand for this sort
        of instruction, and it was supplied by the jottings-down of
        reminiscences of the Lord and his teaching, orally given by those who
        had companied with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus there sprang
        into existence an abundant crop of memorials of the Lord, surrounded
        by every possible guarantee of their truth. And these fragmentary
        records passed from one Church to another. The pious zeal of an
        Antiochian community furnished with the memorials of Peter would
        borrow of Jerusalem the memorials of James and Matthew. One of the
        traditions of John found its way into the Hebrew Gospel—that of the
        visit of Nicodemus; but it never came into the possession of the
        compiler of the first Gospel or of St. Luke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a while,
        each Church set to work to string the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">anecdota</span></span> it possessed into a
        consecutive story, and thus the Synoptical Gospels came into
        being.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvii">[pg
        xxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxvii" id="Pgxxvii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of these, some
        were more complete than others, some were composed of more unique
        material than the others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second Gospel,
        if we may trust Papias, and I see no reason for doubting his
        testimony, is the composition of Mark, the disciple of St. Peter, and
        consists exclusively of the recollections of St. Peter. This Gospel
        was not co-ordinated probably till late, till long after the
        disjointed memorabilia were in circulation. It first circulated in
        Egypt; but in at least one of the Petrine Churches—that of
        Rhossus—the recollections of St. Peter had already been arranged in a
        consecutive memoir, and, in A.D. 190, Serapion, Bishop of Antioch,
        found the Church of Rhossus holding exclusively to this book as a
        Gospel of traditional authority, received from the prince of the
        apostles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of St.
        Matthew, on the other hand, is a diatessaron composed of four
        independent collections of memorabilia. Its groundwork is a book by
        Matthew the apostle, a collection of the discourses of the Lord.
        Whether Matthew wrote also a collection of the acts of the Lord, or
        contributed disconnected anecdotes of the Lord to Churches of his
        founding, and these were woven in with his work on the Lord's
        discourses, is possible, but is conjectural only.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what is clear
        is, that into the first Gospel was incorporated much, not all, of the
        material used by Mark for the construction of his Gospel,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the recollections of St.
        Peter. That the first evangelist did not merely amplify the Mark
        Gospel appears from his arranging the order of his anecdotes
        differently; that he did use the same <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“anecdota”</span> is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexxviii">[pg xxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxviii" id="Pgxxviii"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> evidenced by the fact of his using them
        often word for word.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of the
        Hebrews and the Gospel quoted in the Clementines were composed in
        precisely the same manner, and of the same materials, but not of all
        the same.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the Gospel of
        St. Matthew, as it stands, was the composition of that apostle,
        cannot be seriously maintained; yet its authority as a record of
        facts, not as a record of their chronological sequence, remains
        undisturbed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of St.
        Luke went, apparently, through two editions. After the issue of his
        original Gospel, which, there is reason to believe, is that adopted
        by Marcion, fresh material came into his hands, and he revised and
        amplified his book.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this second
        edition was not the product of another hand, is shown by the fact
        that characteristic expressions found in the original text occur also
        in the additions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pauline
        character of the Luke Gospel has been frequently commented on. It is
        curious to observe how much more pronounced this was in the first
        edition. The third Gospel underwent revision under the influence of
        the same wave of feeling which moved Luke to write the Christian
        Odyssey, the Acts, nominally of the Apostles, really of St. Paul.
        With the imprisonment of Paul the tide turned, and a reconciliatory
        movement set strongly in. Into this the Apostle of Love threw
        himself, and he succeeded in directing it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Apostolic
        Church was a well-spring tumultuously <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexxix">[pg xxix]</span><a name="Pgxxix" id="Pgxxix" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> gushing forth its superabundance of living
        waters; there was a clashing of jets, a conflict of ripples; but
        directly St. John gave to it its definite organization, the flood
        rushed out between these banks, obedient to a common impulse, the
        clashing forces produced a resultant, the conflicting ripples blended
        into rhythmic waves, and the brook became a river, and the river
        became a sea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lost Gospels
        are no mere literary curiosity, the examination of them no barren
        study. They furnish us with most precious information on the manner
        in which all the Gospels were compiled; they enable us in several
        instances to determine the correct reading in our canonical Matthew
        and Luke; they even supply us with particulars to fill lacunae which
        exist, or have been made, in our Synoptics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor stuff
        that has passed current too long among us as Biblical criticism is
        altogether unworthy of English scholars and theologians. The great
        shafts that have been driven into Christian antiquity, the mines that
        have been opened by the patient labours of German students, have not
        received sufficient attention at our hands. If some of our
        commentators timorously venture to their mouths, it is only to shrink
        back again scared at the gnomes their imagination pictures as
        haunting those recesses, or at the abysses down which they may be
        precipitated, that they suppose lie open in those passages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This spirit is
        neither courageous nor honest. God's truth is helped by no man's
        ignorance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be that we
        are dazzled, bewildered by the light and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Josephus.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is somewhat
          remarkable that no contemporary, or even early, account of the life
          of our Lord exists, except from the pens of Christian writers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That we have
          none by Roman or Greek writers is not, perhaps, to be wondered at;
          but it is singular that neither Philo, Josephus, nor Justus of
          Tiberias, should have ever alluded to Christ or to primitive
          Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cause of
          this silence we shall presently investigate. Its existence we must
          first prove.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Philo was born
          at Alexandria about twenty years before Christ. In the year A.D.
          40, he was sent by the Alexandrine Jews on a mission to Caligula,
          to entreat the Emperor not to put in force his order that his
          statue should be erected in the Temple of Jerusalem and in all the
          synagogues of the Jews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Philo was a
          Pharisee. He travelled in Palestine, and speaks of the Essenes he
          saw there; but he says not a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> word about Jesus Christ or his followers. It
          is possible that he may have heard of the new sect, but he probably
          concluded it was but insignificant, and consisted merely of the
          disciples, poor and ignorant, of a Galilean Rabbi, whose doctrines
          he, perhaps, did not stay to inquire into, and supposed that they
          did not differ fundamentally from the traditional teaching of the
          rabbis of his day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Flavius Josephus
          was born A.D. 37—consequently only four years after the death of
          our Lord—at Jerusalem. Till the age of twenty-nine, he lived in
          Jerusalem, and had, therefore, plenty of opportunity of learning
          about Christ and early Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In A.D. 67,
          Josephus became governor of Galilee, on the occasion of the Jewish
          insurrection against the Roman domination. After the fall of
          Jerusalem he passed into the service of Titus, went to Rome, where
          he rose to honour in the household of Vespasian and of Titus, A.D.
          81. The year of his death is not known. He was alive in A.D. 93,
          for his biography is carried down to that date.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Josephus wrote
          at Rome his <span class="tei tei-q">“History of the Jewish
          War,”</span> in seven books, in his own Aramaic language. This he
          finished in the year A.D. 75, and then translated it into Greek. On
          the completion of this work he wrote his <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jewish Antiquities,”</span> a history of the Jews in
          twenty books, from the beginning of the world to the twelfth year
          of the reign of Nero, A.D. 66. He completed this work in the year
          A.D. 93, concluding it with a biography of himself. He also wrote a
          book against Apion on the antiquity of the Jewish people. A book in
          praise of the Maccabees has been attributed to him, but without
          justice. In the first of these works, the larger of the two, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“History of the Jewish War,”</span> he
          treats of the very period when our Lord lived, and in it he
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name=
          "Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> makes no mention of
          him. But in the shorter work, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Jewish
          Antiquities,”</span> in which he goes over briefly the same period
          of time treated of at length in the other work, we find this
          passage:</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

          to him many Jews, and also many Greeks. [This was the Christ.] But
          when Pilate, at the instigation of our chiefs, had condemned him to
          crucifixion, they who had at first loved him did not cease; [for he
          appeared to them on the third day again alive; for the divine
          prophets had foretold this, together with many other wonderful
          things concerning him], and even to this time the community of
          Christians, called after him, continues to
            exist.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this
          passage is spurious has been almost universally acknowledged. One
          may be, perhaps, accused of killing dead birds, if one again
          examines and discredits the passage; but as the silence of Josephus
          on the subject which we are treating is a point on which it will be
          necessary to insist, we cannot omit as brief a discussion as
          possible of this celebrated passage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage is
          first quoted by Eusebius (fl. A.D. 315) in two places,<a id=
          "noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> but it
          was unknown to Justin Martyr (fl. A.D. 140), Clement of Alexandria
          (fl. A.D. 192), <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
          004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Tertullian (fl. A.D. 193), and Origen (fl. A.D. 230). Such a
          testimony would certainly have been produced by Justin in his
          Apology, or in his Controversy with Trypho the Jew, had it existed
          in the copies of Josephus at his time. The silence of Origen is
          still more significant. Celsus in his book against Christianity
          introduces a Jew. Origen attacks the arguments of Celsus and his
          Jew. He could not have failed to quote the words of Josephus, whose
          writings he knew, had the passage existed in the genuine
          text.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=
          "#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          paragraph interrupts the chain of ideas in the original text.
          Before this passage comes an account of how Pilate, seeing there
          was a want of pure drinking water in Jerusalem, conducted a stream
          into the city from a spring 200 stadia distant, and ordered that
          the cost should be defrayed out of the treasury of the Temple. This
          occasioned a riot. Pilate disguised Roman soldiers as Jews, with
          swords under their cloaks, and sent them among the rabble, with
          orders to arrest the ringleaders.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was done.
          The Jews finding themselves set upon by other Jews, fell into
          confusion; one Jew attacked another, and the whole company of
          rioters melted away. <span class="tei tei-q">“And in this
          manner,”</span> says Josephus, <span class="tei tei-q">“was this
          insurrection suppressed.”</span> Then follows the paragraph about
          Jesus, beginning, <span class="tei tei-q">“At this time lived
          Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man,”</span>
          &amp;c.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the passage
          is immediately followed by, <span class="tei tei-q">“About this
          time another misfortune threw the Jews into disturbance; and in
          Rome an event happened in the temple of Isis which produced great
          scandal.”</span> And then he tells an indelicate story of religious
          deception which need not be repeated here. The misfortune
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name=
          "Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which befel the Jews
          was, as he afterwards relates, that Tiberius drove them out of
          Rome. The reason of this was, he says, that a noble Roman lady who
          had become a proselyte had sent gold and purple to the temple at
          Jerusalem. But this reason is not sufficient. It is clear from what
          precedes—a story of sacerdotal fraud—that there was some connection
          between the incidents in the mind of Josephus. Probably the Jews
          had been guilty of religious deceptions in Rome, and had made a
          business of performing cures and expelling demons, with talismans
          and incantations, and for this had obtained rich payment.<a id=
          "noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
          connection that exists between the passage about the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“other misfortune that befel the Jews”</span> and the
          former one about the riot suppressed by Pilate, it appears evident
          that the whole of the paragraph concerning our Lord is an
          interpolation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That Josephus
          could not have written the passage as it stands, is clear enough,
          for only a Christian would speak of Jesus in the terms employed.
          Josephus was a Pharisee and a Jewish priest; he shows in all his
          writings that he believes in Judaism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          suggested that Josephus may have written about Christ as in the
          passage quoted, but that the portions within brackets are the
          interpolations of a Christian copyist. But when these portions
          within brackets are removed, the passage loses all its interest,
          and is a dry statement utterly unlike the sort of notice Josephus
          would have been likely to insert. He gives colour to his
          narratives, his incidents are always sketched <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with vigour; this account would be
          meagre beside those of the riot of the Jews and the rascality of
          the priests of Isis. Josephus asserts, moreover, that in his time
          there were four sects among the Jews—the Pharisees, the Sadducees,
          the Essenes, and the sect of Judas of Gamala. He gives tolerably
          copious particulars about these sects and their teachings, but of
          the Christian sect he says not a word. Had he wished to write about
          it, he would have given full details, likely to interest his
          readers, and not have dismissed the subject in a couple of
          lines.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was perhaps
          felt by the early Christians that the silence of Josephus—so famous
          an historian, and a Jew—on the life, miracles and death of the
          Founder of Christianity, was extremely inconvenient; the fact could
          not fail to be noticed by their adversaries. Some Christian
          transcriber may have argued, Either Josephus knew nothing of the
          miracles performed by Christ,—in which case he is a weighty
          testimony against them,—or he must have heard of Jesus, but not
          have deemed his acts, as they were related to him, of sufficient
          importance to find a place in his History. Arguing thus, the
          copyist took the opportunity of rectifying the omission, written
          from the standpoint of a Pharisee, and therefore designating the
          Lord as merely a wise man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
          another explanation of this interpolation, which will hardly seem
          credible to the reader at this stage of the examination, viz. that
          it was inserted by a Pharisee after the destruction of Jerusalem;
          and this is the explanation I am inclined to adopt. At that time
          there was a mutual tendency to sink their differences, and unite,
          in the Nazarene Church and the Jews. The cause of this will be
          given further on; sufficient for our purpose that such a tendency
          did exist. Both Jew and Nazarene were involved in the same exile,
          crushed by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg
          007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the same blow, united in the same antipathies. The Pharisees were
          disposed to regret the part they had taken in putting Jesus to
          death, and to acknowledge that he had been a good and great Rabbi.
          The Jewish Nazarenes, on their side, made no exalted claims for the
          Lord as being the incarnate Son of God, and later even, as we learn
          from the Clementine Homilies, refused to admit his divinity. The
          question dividing the Nazarene from the Jew gradually became one of
          whether Christ was to be recognized as a prophet or not; and the
          Pharisees, or some of them at least, were disposed to allow as much
          as this.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was under
          this conciliatory feeling that I think it probable the
          interpolation was made, at first by a Jew, but afterwards it was
          amplified by a Christian. I think this probable, from the fact of
          its not being the only interpolation of the sort effected. Suidas
          has an article on the name <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus,”</span>
          in which he tells us that Josephus mentions him, and says that he
          sacrificed with the priests in the temple. He quoted from an
          interpolated copy of Josephus, and this interpolation could not
          have been made by either a Gentile or a Nazarene Christian: not by
          a Gentile, for such a statement would have been pointless,
          purposeless to him; and it could not have been made by a Nazarene,
          for the Nazarenes, as will presently be shown, were strongly
          opposed to the sacrificial system in the temple. The interpolation
          must therefore have been made by a Jew, and by a Jew with a
          conciliatory purpose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is curious to
          note the use made of the interpolation now found in the text.
          Eusebius, after quoting it, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“When

          he had obtained the office of high-priest, was of a rash and daring
          character; he belonged to the sect of the Sadducees, which, as I
          have already remarked, exhibited especial severity in the discharge
          of justice. Being of such a character, Ananus thought the time when
          Festus was dead, and Albinus was yet upon the road, a fit
          opportunity for calling a council of judges, and for bringing
          before them James, the brother of him who is called Christ, and
          some others: he accused them as transgressors of the law, and had
          them stoned to death. But the most moderate men of the city, who
          also were reckoned most learned in the law, were offended at this
          proceeding. They therefore sent privately to the king (Agrippa
          II.), entreating him to send orders to Ananus not to attempt such a
          thing again, for he had no right to do it. And some went to meet
          Albinus, then coming from Alexandria, and put him in mind that
          Ananus was not justified, without his consent, in assembling a
          court of justice. Albinus, approving what they said, angrily wrote
          to Ananus, and threatened him with punishment; and king Agrippa
          took from him his office of high-priest, and gave it to Jesus, the
          son of Donnæus.</span><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This passage is
          also open to objection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          Hegesippus, a Jewish Christian, who wrote a History of the Church
          about the year A.D. 170, of which fragments have been preserved by
          Eusebius, St. James was killed in a tumult, and not by sentence of
          a court. He relates that James, the brother of Jesus, was thrown
          down from a wing of the temple, stoned, and finally despatched with
          a fuller's club. Clement of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Alexandria confirms this, and is quoted by
          Eusebius accordingly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eusebius quotes
          the passage from Josephus, without noticing that the two accounts
          do not agree. According to the statement of Hegesippus, St. James
          suffered alone; according to that of Josephus, several other
          victims to the anger or zeal of Ananus perished with him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears that
          some of the copies of Josephus were tampered with by copyists, for
          Theophylact says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The wrath of God fell on
          them (the Jews) when their city was taken; and Josephus testifies
          that these things happened to them on account of the death of
          Jesus.”</span> But Origen, speaking of Josephus, says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This writer, though he did not believe Jesus to be the
          Christ, inquiring into the cause of the overthrow of Jerusalem and
          the demolition of the temple ... says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘These things befel the Jews in vindication of James,
          called the Just, who was the brother of Jesus, called the Christ,
          forasmuch as they killed him who was a most righteous
          man.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href=
          "#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>
          Josephus, as we have seen, says nothing of the sort; consequently
          Origen must have quoted from an interpolated copy. And this
          interpolation suffered further alteration, by a later hand, by the
          substitution of the name of Jesus for that of James.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is therefore
          by no means unlikely that the name of James, the Lord's brother,
          may have been inserted in the account of the high-handed dealing of
          Ananus in place of another name.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, it is
          by no means impossible to reconcile <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the two accounts. The martyrdom of St. James
          is an historical fact, and it is likely to have taken place during
          the time when Ananus had the power in his hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For fifty years
          the pontificate had been in the same family, with scarcely an
          interruption, and Ananus, or Hanan, was the son of Annas, who had
          condemned Christ. They were Sadducees, and as such were
          persecuting. St. Paul, by appealing to his Pharisee principles,
          enlisted the members of that faction in his favour when brought
          before Ananias.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href=
          "#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostles
          based their teaching on the Resurrection, the very doctrine most
          repugnant to the Sadducees; and their accounts of visions of angels
          repeated among the people must have irritated the dominant faction
          who denied the existence of these spirits. It can hardly be matter
          of surprise that the murder of James should have taken place when
          Ananus was supreme in Jerusalem. If that were the case, Josephus no
          doubt mentioned James, and perhaps added the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The brother of him who is called Christ;”</span> or
          these words may have been inserted by a transcriber in place of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“of Sechania,”</span> or Bar-Joseph.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is all that
          Josephus says, or is thought to have said, about Jesus and the
          early Christians.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time
          as Josephus, there lived another Jewish historian, Justus of
          Tiberias, whom Josephus mentions, and blames for not having
          published his History of the Wars of the Jews during the life of
          Vespasian and Titus. St. Jerome includes Justus in his Catalogue of
          Ecclesiastical Writers, and Stephen of Byzantium mentions him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can only be
          answered by laying before the reader a picture of the Christian
          Church in the first century. A critical examination of the writings
          of the first age of the Church reveals unexpected disclosures.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. It shows us
          that the Church at Jerusalem, and throughout Palestine and Asia

          indistinguishable from a modified Essenism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. And that the
          difference between the Gentile Church founded by St. Paul, and the

          that which separated the latter from Judaism <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This applies to
          the period from the Ascension to the close of the first century,—to
          the period, that is, in which Josephus and Justus lived, and about

          thoroughly, or was initiated into their secret doctrines.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Essenes

          every other in the world, deserving of wonder; men living among
          palm-trees, without wives, without money. Every day their number is
          replenished by a new troop of settlers, for those join them who
          have been visited by the reverses of fortune, who are tired of the
          world and its style of living. Thus happens what might seem

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this first
          seat of the Essenes colonies detached themselves, and settled in
          other parts of Palestine; they settled not only in remote and
          solitary places, but in the midst of villages and towns. In Samaria
          they flourished.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=

          According to Josephus, some of the Essenes were willing to act as
          magistrates, and it is evident that such as lived in the midst of
          society could not have followed the strict rule imposed on the
          solitaries. There must therefore have been various degrees of
          Essenism, some severer, more exclusive than the others; and
          Josephus distinguishes four such classes in the sect. Some of the
          Essenes remained celibates, others married. The more exalted and
          exclusive Essenes would not touch one of the more lax
          brethren.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href=

          have greatly devoted themselves to the cure of diseases, and, if we

          at our blessed Lord's teaching, we find in it much in common with
          that of the Essenes. The same insisting before the multitude on
          purity of thought, disengagement of affections from the world,
          disregard of wealth and clothing and delicate food, pursuit of
          inward piety instead of ostentatious formalism.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His miracles of
          healing also, to the ordinary observer, served to identify him with
          the sect which made healing the great object of their study.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But these were
          not the only points of connection between him and the Essenes. The
          Essenes, instead of holding the narrow prejudices of the Jews
          against Samaritans and Gentiles, extended their philanthropy to
          all. They considered that all men had been made in the image of
          God, that all were rational beings, and that therefore God's care
          was not confined to the Jewish nation, salvation was not limited to
          the circumcision.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Essenes,
          moreover, exhibited a peculiar veneration for light. It was their
          daily custom to turn their faces devoutly towards the rising of the
          sun, and to chant hymns addressed to that luminary, purporting that
          his beams ought to fall on nothing impure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we look at
          the Gospels, we cannot fail to note how incessantly Christ recurs
          in his teaching to light as the symbol of the truth he
          taught,<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href=
          "#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          that in which his disciples were to walk, of which they were to be
          children, which they were to strive to obtain in all its purity and
          brilliancy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Essenes,
          moreover, had their esoteric doctrine; to the vulgar they had an
          esoteric teaching on virtue and disregard of the world, whilst
          among themselves they had a secret lore, of which, unfortunately,
          we know nothing certain. In like manner, we find our Lord speaking
          in parables to the multitude, and privately revealing their
          interpretation to his chosen disciples. <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Clementines,
          moreover, preserve a saying of our Lord, contained in the Gospel in
          use among the Ebionites, <span class="tei tei-q">“Keep the
          mysteries for me, and for the sons of my house.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Essenes,
          though showing great veneration for the Mosaic law, distinguished
          between its precepts, for some they declared were interpolations,
          and did not belong to the original revelation; all the glosses and
          traditions of the Rabbis they repudiated, as making the true Word
          of none effect.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=
          "#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Amongst other things that they rejected was the sacrificial system
          of the Law. They regarded this with the utmost horror, and would
          not be present at any of the sacrifices. They sent gifts to the
          Temple, but never any beast, that its blood might be shed. To the
          ordinary worship of the Temple, apart from the sacrifices, they do
          not seem to have objected. The Clementine Homilies carry us into
          the very heart of Ebionite Christianity in the second, if not the
          first century, and show us what was the Church of St. James and St.
          Peter, the Church of the Circumcision, with its peculiarities and
          prejudices intensified by isolation and opposition. In that curious
          book we find the same hostility to the sacrificial system of Moses,
          the same abhorrence of blood-shedding in the service of God. This
          temper of mind can only be an echo of primitive Nazarene
          Christianity, for in the second century the Temple and its
          sacrifices were no more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Primitive Jewish
          Christianity, therefore, reproduced what was an essential feature
          of Essenism—a rejection of the Mosaic sacrifices.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another point
          Nazarene Christianity resembled Essenism, in the poverty of its
          members, their simplicity in dress and in diet, their community of
          goods. This we learn from Hegesippus, who represents St. James,
          Bishop of Jerusalem, as truly an ascetic as any mediaeval monk; and
          from the Clementines, which make St. Peter feed on olives and bread
          only, and wear but one coat. The name of Ebionite, which was given
          to the Nazarenes, signified <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          poor.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was one
          point more of resemblance, or possible resemblance, but this was
          one not likely to be observed by those without. The Therapeutae in
          Egypt, who were apparently akin to the Essenes in Palestine, at
          their sacred feasts ate bread and salt. Salt seems to have been
          regarded by them with religious superstition, as being an
          antiseptic, and symbolical of purity.<a id="noteref_40" name=
          "noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the
          Essenes of Judaea also thus regarded, and ceremonially used, salt.
          We have no proof, it is true; but it is not improbable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now one of the
          peculiarities of the Ebionite Church in Palestine, as revealed to
          us by the Clementines, was the use of salt with the bread in their
          celebrations of the Holy Communion.<a id="noteref_41" name=
          "noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if Christ
          and the early Church, by their teaching and practice, conformed
          closely in many things to the doctrine and customs of the Essenes,
          in some points they differed from them. The Essenes were strict
          Sabbatarians. On the seventh day they would not move a vessel from
          one place to another, or satisfy any of the wants of nature. Even
          the sick and dying, rather than <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> break the Sabbath, abstained from meat and
          drink on that day. Christ's teaching was very different from this;
          he ate, walked about, taught, and performed miracles on the
          Sabbath. But though he relaxed the severity of observance, he did
          not abrogate the institution; and the Nazarene Church, after the
          Ascension, continued to venerate and observe the Sabbath as of
          divine appointment. The observance of the Lord's-day was apparently
          due to St. Paul alone, and sprang up in the Gentile churches<a id=
          "noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> in
          Asia Minor and Greece of his founding. When the churches of Peter
          and Paul were reconciled and fused together at the close of the
          century, under the influence of St. John, both days were observed
          side by side; and the Apostolical Constitutions represent St. Peter
          and St. Paul in concord decreeing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let the
          slaves work five days; but on the Sabbath-day and the Lord's-day
          let them have leisure to go to church for instruction and piety. We
          have said that the Sabbath is to be observed on account of the
          Creation, and the Lord's-day on account of the
          Resurrection.”</span><a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href=
          "#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          Ascension, the Christian Church in Jerusalem attended the services
          in the Temple<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href=
          "#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> daily,
          as did the devout Jews. There is, however, no proof that they
          assisted at the sacrifices. They continued to circumcise their
          children; they observed the Mosaic distinction of meats; they
          abstained from things strangled and from blood.<a id="noteref_45"
          name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctrine of
          the apostles after the descent of the Holy Ghost was founded on the
          Resurrection. They went everywhere preaching the Resurrection; they
          claimed to be witnesses to it, they declared that Jesus had risen,
          they had seen him after he had risen, that <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> therefore the resurrection of all men was
          possible.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=
          "#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> The
          doctrine of the Resurrection was held most zealously by the
          Pharisees; it was opposed by the Sadducees. This vehement
          proclamation of the disputed doctrine, this production of evidence
          which overthrew it, irritated the Sadducees then in power. We are
          expressly told that they <span class="tei tei-q">“came upon them
          (the apostles), being grieved that they taught the people, and
          preached through Jesus the Resurrection.”</span> This led to
          persecution of the apostles. But the apostles, in maintaining the
          doctrine of the Resurrection, were fighting the battles of the
          Pharisees, who took their parts against the dominant Sadducee
          faction,<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=
          "#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> and
          many, glad of a proof which would overthrow Sadduceeism, joined the
          Church.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href=
          "#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can therefore
          perfectly understand how the Sadducees hated and persecuted the
          apostles, and how the orthodox Pharisees were disposed to hail them
          as auxiliaries against the common enemy. And Sadduceeism was at
          that time in full power and arrogance, exercising intolerable
          tyranny.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Herod the Great,
          having fallen in love with Mariamne, daughter of a certain Simon,
          son of Boethus of Alexandria, desired to marry her, and saw no
          other means of ennobling his father-in-law than by elevating him to
          the office of high-priest (B.C. 28). This intriguing family
          maintained possession of the high-priesthood for thirty-five years.
          It was like the Papacy in the house of Tusculum, or the primacy of
          the Irish Church in that of the princes of Armagh. Closely allied
          to the reigning family, it lost its hold of the high-priesthood on
          the deposition of Archelaus, but recovered it in A.D. 42. This
          family, called Boethusim, formed a sacerdotal <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nobility, filling all the offices of
          trust and emolument about the Temple, very worldly, supremely
          indifferent to their religious duties, and defiantly sceptical.
          They were Sadducees, denying angel, and devil, and resurrection;
          living in easy self-indulgence; exasperating the Pharisees by their
          heresy, grieving the Essenes by their irreligion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the face of
          the secularism of the ecclesiastical rulers, the religious zeal of
          the people was sure to break out in some form of dissent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John the Baptist
          was the St. Francis of Assisi, the Wesley of his time. If the
          Baptist was not actually an Essene, he was regarded as one by the
          indiscriminating public eye, never nice in detecting minute
          dogmatic differences, judging only by external, broad resemblances
          of practice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ruling
          worldliness took alarm at his bold denunciations of evil, and his
          head fell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus of
          Nazareth seemed to stand forth occupying the same post, to be the
          mouthpiece of the long-brooding discontent; and the alarmed party
          holding the high-priesthood and the rulership of the Sanhedrim
          compassed his death. To the Sadducean Boethusim, who rose into
          power again in A.D. 42, Christianity was still obnoxious, but more
          dangerous; for by falling back on the grand doctrine of
          Resurrection, it united with it the great sect of the
          Pharisees.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under these
          circumstances the Pharisees began to regret the condemnation and
          death of Christ as a mistake of policy. Under provocation and
          exclusion from office, they were glad to unite with the Nazarene
          Church in combating the heretical sect and family which monopolized
          the power, just as at the present day in Germany Ultramontanism and
          Radicalism are fraternizing. Jerusalem fell, and Sadduceeism fell
          with it, but the link <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg
          021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          which united Pharisaism and Christianity was not broken as yet; if
          the Jewish believers and the Pharisees had not a common enemy to
          fight, they had a common loss to deplore; and when they mingled
          their tears in banishment, they forgot that they were not wholly
          one in faith. Christianity had been regarded by them as a modified
          Essenism, an Essenism gravitating towards Pharisaism, which lent to
          Pharisaism an element of strength and growth in which it was
          naturally deficient—that zeal and spirituality which alone will
          attract and quicken the popular mind into enthusiasm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the
          Jewish Pharisees and Jewish Nazarenes were forgetting their
          differences and approximating, the great and growing company of
          Gentile believers assumed a position of open, obtrusive
          indifference at first, and then of antagonism, to the Law, not
          merely to the Law as accepted by the Pharisee, but to the Law as
          winnowed by the Essene.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostles at
          Jerusalem were not disposed to force the Gentile converts into
          compliance with all the requirements of that Law, which they
          regarded as vitiated by human glosses; but they maintained that the
          converts must abstain from meats offered to idols, from the flesh
          of such animals as had been strangled, and from blood.<a id=

          may trust the Clementines, which represent the exaggerated
          Judaizing Christianity of the ensuing century, they insisted also
          on the religious obligation of personal cleanliness, and on
          abstention from such meats as had been pronounced unclean by
          Moses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these
          requirements one more was added, affecting the relations of married
          people; these were subjected to certain restrictions, the

          trust only in the Prophet of Truth, and to be baptized for the
          remission of sins, to abstain from the table of devils, that is,
          food offered to idols, from dead carcases, from animals that have
          been suffocated or mangled by wild beasts, and from blood; not to
          live impurely; to be careful to wash when unclean; that the women
          keep the law of purification; that all be sober-minded, given to
          good works, refrain from wrong-doing, look for eternal life from
          the all-powerful God, and ask with prayer and continual
          supplication that they may win it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These simple and
          not very intolerable requirements nearly produced a schism. St.
          Paul took the lead in rejecting some of the restraints imposed by
          the apostles at Jerusalem. He had no patience with their minute
          prescriptions about meats: <span class="tei tei-q">“Touch not,
          taste not, handle not, which all are to perish with the
          using.”</span><a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=
          "#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> It was
          inconvenient for the Christian invited to supper to have to make
          inquiries if the ox had been knocked down, or the fowl had had its
          neck wrung, before he could eat. What right had the apostles to
          impose restrictions on conjugal relations? St. Paul waxed hot over
          this. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye observe days and months and times
          and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour
          in vain.”</span><a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=
          "#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let no man judge you in meat or in drink,
          or in respect of an holiday, or of the new moons, or of the
          sabbath-days.”</span><a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
          "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> It was
          exactly these sabbaths and new moons on which the Nazarene Church
          imposed restraint on married persons.<a id="noteref_54" name=
          "noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> As for
          meat offered in sacrifice to idols, St. Paul relaxed the order of
          the apostles assembled in council. It was no matter of importance
          whether <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg
          023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          men ate sacrificial meat or not, for <span class="tei tei-q">“an
          idol is nothing in the world.”</span> Yet with tender care for
          scrupulous souls, he warned his disciples not to flaunt their
          liberty in the eyes of the sensitive, and offend weak consciences.
          He may have thus allowed, in opposition to the apostles at
          Jerusalem, because his common sense got the better of his prudence.
          But the result was the widening of the breach that had opened at
          Antioch when he withstood Peter to the face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostles had
          abolished circumcision as a rite to be imposed on the Gentile
          proselytes, but the children of Jewish believers were still
          submitted by their parents, with the consent of the apostles, to
          the Mosaic institution. This St. Paul would not endure. He made it
          a matter of vital importance. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, I,
          Paul, say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit
          you nothing. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised,
          that he is a debtor to do the whole law. Christ is become of no
          effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are
          fallen from grace.”</span><a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55"
          href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> In a
          word, to submit to this unpleasant, but otherwise harmless
          ceremony, was equivalent to renouncing Christ, losing the favour of
          God and the grace of the Holy Spirit. It was incurring damnation.
          The blood of Christ, his blessed teaching, his holy example, could
          <span class="tei tei-q">“profit nothing”</span> to the unfortunate
          child which had been submitted to the knife of the circumciser.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The contest was
          carried on with warmth. St. Paul, in his Epistle to the Galatians,
          declared his independence of the Jewish-Christian Church; his
          Gospel was not that of Peter and James. Those who could not
          symbolize with him he pronounced <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“accursed.”</span> The pillar apostles, James, Cephas
          and John, had given, indeed, the right hand of fellowship to the
          Apostle of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg
          024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Gentiles, when they imposed on his converts from heathenism the
          light rule of abstinence from sacrificial meats, blood and
          fornication; but it was with the understanding that he was to
          preach to the Gentiles exclusively, and not to interfere with the
          labours of St. Peter and St. James among the Jews. But St. Paul was
          impatient of restraint; he would not be bound to confine his
          teaching to the uncircumcision, nor would he allow his Jewish
          converts to be deprived of their right to that full and frank
          liberty which he supposed the Gospel to proclaim.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Paul's followers
          assumed a distinct name, arrogated to themselves the exclusive
          right to be entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Christians,”</span>
          whilst they flung on the old apostolic community of Nazarenes the
          disdainful title of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Circumcision.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An attempt was
          made to maintain a decent, superficial unity, by the rival systems
          keeping geographically separate. But such a compromise was
          impossible. Wherever Jews accepted the doctrine that Christ was the
          Messiah there would be found old-fashioned people clinging to the
          customs of their childhood respecting Moses, and reverencing the
          Law; to whom the defiant use of meats they had been taught to
          regard as unclean would be ever repulsive, and flippant denial of
          the Law under which, the patriarchs and prophets had served God
          must ever prove offensive. Such would naturally form a Judaizing
          party,—a party not disposed to force their modes of life and
          prejudices on the Gentile converts, but who did not wish to
          dissociate Christianity from Mosaism, who would view the Gospel as
          the sweet flower that had blossomed from the stem of the Law, not
          as an axe laid at its root.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the attempt
          to reconcile both parties was impossible at that time, in the heat,
          intoxication and extravagance of controversy. In the Epistle to the
          Galatians <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg
          025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          we see St. Paul writing in a strain of fiery excitement against
          those who interfered with the liberty of his converts, imposing on
          them the light rule of the Council of Jerusalem. The followers of
          St. Peter and St. James are designated as those who <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“bewitch”</span> his converts, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“remove them from the grace of Christ to another
          Gospel;”</span> who <span class="tei tei-q">“trouble”</span> his
          little Church in its easy liberty, <span class="tei tei-q">“would
          pervert the gospel of Christ.”</span> To those only who hold with
          him in complete emancipation of the believer from vexatious
          restraints, <span class="tei tei-q">“to as many as walk according
          to this rule,”</span> will he accord his benediction, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace and mercy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He assumed a
          position of hostility to the Law. He placed the Law on one side and
          the Gospel on the other; here restraint, there liberty; here
          discipline, there freedom. A choice must be made between them; an
          election between Moses and Christ. There was no conciliation
          possible. To be under the Law was not to be under grace; the Law
          was a <span class="tei tei-q">“curse,”</span> from which Christ had
          redeemed man. Paul says he had not known lust but by the Law which
          said, Thou shalt not covet. Men under the Law were bound by its
          requirements, as a woman is bound to a husband as long as he lives,
          but when the husband is dead she is free,—so those who accept the
          Gospel are free from the Law and all its requirements. The law
          which said, Thou shalt not covet, is dead. Sin was the infraction
          of the law. But the law being dead, sin is no more. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not
          imputed where there is no law.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Where no law is, there is no transgression.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we are delivered from the law, that
          being dead wherein we were held.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such an attack
          upon what was reverenced and observed by the Jewish Christians, and
          such doctrine which seemed to throw wide the flood-gates of
          immorality, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg
          026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          naturally excited alarm and indignation among those who followed
          the more temperate teaching of Peter and James and John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The converts of
          St. Paul, in their eagerness to manifest their emancipation from
          the Law, rolled up ceremonial and moral restrictions in one bundle,
          and flung both clean away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Corinthians,
          to show their freedom under the Gospel, boasted their licence to
          commit incest <span class="tei tei-q">“such as was not so much as
          named among the Gentiles.”</span><a id="noteref_56" name=

          later Pauline Christians went further. The law was, it was agreed,
          utterly bad, but it was promulgated by God; therefore the God of
          the Law was not the same deity as the God of the Gospel, but
          another inferior being, the Demiurge, whose province was rule,
          discipline, restraint, whereas the God of the Gospel was the God of
          absolute freedom and unrestrained licence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They refused to
          acknowledge any Scriptures save the Gospel of St. Luke, or rather
          the Gospel of the Lord, another recension of that Gospel, drawn up
          by order of St. Paul, and the Epistles of the Apostle of the
          Gentiles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even in the
          first age the disorders were terrible. St. Paul's Epistles give
          glimpses of the wild outbreak of antinomianism that everywhere
          followed his preaching,—the drunkenness which desecrated the
          Eucharists, the backbitings, quarrellings, fornication,
          lasciviousness, which called forth such indignant denunciation from
          the great apostle.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg
          027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet he was as
          guiltless of any wish to relax the restraints of morality as was,
          in later days, his great counterpart Luther. Each rose up against a
          narrow formalism, and proclaimed the liberty of the Christian from
          obligation to barren ceremonial; but there were those in the first,
          as there were those in the sixteenth century, with more zeal than
          self-control, who found <span class="tei tei-q">“Justification by
          Faith only”</span> a very comfortable doctrine, quite capable of
          accommodating itself to a sensual or careless life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Paul may
          have seen, and probably did see, that Christianity would never make
          way if one part of the community was to be fettered by legal
          restrictions, and the other part was to be free. According to the
          purpose apparent in the minds of James and Peter, the Jewish
          converts were to remain Jews, building up Christian faith on the
          foundation of legal prescriptions, whilst the Gentile converts were
          to start from a different point. There could be no unity in the
          Church under this system—all must go under the Law, or all must
          fling it off. The Church, starting from her cradle with such an
          element of weakness in her constitution, must die prematurely.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was right in
          his view. But it is by no means certain that St. Peter and St.
          James were as obstinately opposed to the gradual relaxation of
          legal restrictions, and the final extinction or transformation of
          the ceremonial Law, as he supposed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the heat and
          noise of controversy, he no doubt used unguarded language, said
          more than he thought, and his converts were not slow to take him
          <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">au pied de la lettre</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tone of
          Paul's letters shows conclusively that not for one moment would he
          relax moral obligation. With the unsuspiciousness of a guileless
          spirit, he never suspected <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that his words, taken and acted upon as a
          practical system, were capable of becoming the charter of
          antinomianism. Yet it was so. No sooner had he begun to denounce
          the Law, than he was understood to mean the whole Law, not merely
          its ceremonial part. When he began to expatiate on the freedom of
          Grace, he was understood to imply that human effort was overridden.
          When he proclaimed Justification by Faith only, it was held that he
          swept away for ever obligation to keep the Commandments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The results were
          precisely the same in the sixteenth century, when Luther
          re-affirmed Paulinism, with all his warmth and want of caution. At
          first he proclaimed his doctrines boldly, without thought of their
          practical application. When he saw the results, he was staggered,
          and hasted to provide checks, and qualify his former words:</p>

          argument they use against us is that no good result has come of my
          doctrine. And, in fact, scarce did I begin to preach my Gospel
          before the country burst into frightful revolt; schisms and sects
          tore the Church; everywhere honesty, morality, and good order fell
          into ruin; every one thought to live independently, and conduct
          himself after his own fancy and caprices and pleasure, as though
          the reign of the Gospel drew with it the suppression of all law,
          right and discipline. Licence and all kinds of vices and turpitudes
          are carried in all conditions to an extent they never were before.
          In those days there was some observance of duty, the people
          especially were decorous; but now, like a wild horse without rein
          and bridle, without constraint or decency, they rush on the

          Petrine Christians at Jerusalem were startled at the tidings that
          reached them from Asia Minor and Greece. It was necessary that the
          breach should be closed. The Church at Jerusalem was poor; a
          collection was ordered by St. Paul to be made for its necessities.
          He undertook to carry the money himself to Jerusalem, and at the
          same time, by conforming to an insignificant legal custom, to
          recover the regard and confidence of the apostles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This purpose
          emerges at every point in the history of St. Paul's last visit to
          Jerusalem. But it was too late. The alienation of parties was too
          complete to be salved over with a gift of money and appeased by
          shaven crowns.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When St. Paul
          was taken, he made one ineffectual effort to establish his relation
          to Judaism, by an appeal to the Pharisees. But it failed. He was
          regarded with undisguised abhorrence by the Jews, with coldness by
          the Nazarenes. The Jews would have murdered him. We do not hear
          that a Nazarene visited him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further traces
          of the conflict appear in the Epistles. The authenticity of the
          Epistle to the Hebrews has been doubted, disputed, and on weighty
          grounds. It is saturated with Philonism, whole passages of Philo
          re-appear in the Epistle to the Hebrews, yet I cannot doubt that it
          is by St. Paul. When the heat of contest was somewhat abated, when
          he saw how wofully he had been misunderstood by his Jewish and
          Gentile converts in the matter of the freedom of the Gospel; when
          he learned how that even the heathen, not very nice about morals,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name=
          "Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> spoke of the
          scandals that desecrated the assemblies of the Pauline
          Christians,—then no doubt he saw that it was necessary to lay down
          a plain, sharp line of demarcation between those portions of the
          Law which were not binding, and those which were. Following a train
          of thought suggested by Philo, whose works he had just read, he
          showed that the ceremonial, sacrificial law was symbolical, and
          that, as it typified Christ, the coming of the One symbolized
          abrogated the symbol. But the moral law had no such natural limit,
          therefore it was permanent. Yet he was anxious not to be thought to
          abandon his high views of the dignity of Faith; and the Epistle to
          the Hebrews contains one of the finest passages of his writing, the
          magnificent eulogy on Faith in the 11th chapter. St. Paul, like
          Luther, was not a clear thinker, could not follow a thread of
          argument uninterruptedly to its logical conclusion. Often, when he
          saw that conclusion looming before him, he hesitated to assert it,
          and proceeded to weaken the cogency of his former reasoning, or
          diverged to some collateral or irrelevant topic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Epistle to
          the Hebrews is, I doubt not, a reflex of the mind of Paul under the
          circumstances indicated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Epistle,
          there can be little question, called forth the counterblast of the
          Epistle of James, the Lord's brother. But the writer of that
          Epistle exhibits an unjust appreciation of the character of St.
          Paul. Paul was urged on by conviction, and not actuated by vanity.
          Yet the exasperation must have been great which called forth the
          indignant exclamation, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wilt thou know, O

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extreme
          Pauline party went on their way; Marcion, Valentine, Mark, were its
          successive high-priests and prophets. It ran from one extravagance
          to another, till it sank into the preposterous sect of the
          Cainites; in their frantic hostility to the Law, canonizing Cain,
          Esau, Pharaoh, Saul, all who are denounced in the Old Testament as
          having resisted the God of the Law, and deifying the Serpent, the
          Deceiver, as the God of the Gospel who had first revealed to Eve
          the secret of liberty, of emancipation from restraint.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But disorders
          always are on the surface, patent to every one, and cry out for a
          remedy. Those into which the advanced Pauline party had fallen were
          so flagrant, so repugnant to the good sense and right feelings of
          both Jew and Gentile believers, that they forced on a reaction. The
          most impracticable antinomians on one side, and obstructive
          Judaizers on the other, were cut off, or cut themselves off, from
          the Church; and a temper of mutual concession prevailed among the
          moderate. At the head of this movement stood St. John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work of
          reconciliation was achieved by the Apostle of Love. A happy
          compromise was effected. The Sabbath and the Lord's-day were both
          observed, side by side. Nothing was said on one side about
          distinction in meats, and the sacred obligation of washing; and on
          the other, the Gentile Christians adopted the Psalms of David and
          much of the ceremonial of the Temple into their liturgy. The
          question of circumcision was not mooted. It had died out of
          exhaustion, and the doctrine of Justification was accepted as a
          harmless opinion, to be constantly corrected by the moral law and
          common sense.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg
          034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar
          compromise took place at the English Reformation. In deference to
          the dictation of foreign reformers, the Anglican divines adopted
          their doctrine of Justification by Faith only into the Articles,
          but took the wise precaution of inserting as an antidote the
          Decalogue in the Communion Office, and of ordering it to be written
          up, where every one might read, in the body of the church.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The compromise
          effected by the influence and authority of St. John was rejected by
          extreme partizans on the right and the left. The extreme Paulines
          continued to refuse toleration to the Law and the Old Testament.
          The Nazarene community had also its impracticable zealots who would
          not endure the reading of the Pauline Epistles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Church,
          towards the close of the apostolic age, was made up of a
          preponderance of Gentile converts; in numbers and social position
          they stood far above the Nazarenes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under St. John,
          the Church assumed a distinctively Gentile character. In its
          constitution, religious worship, in its religious views, it
          differed widely from the Nazarene community in Palestine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          disappearance from its programme of distinction of meats and
          circumcision, its connection with Judaism had disappeared. But
          Nazarenism was not confined to Palestine. In Rome, in Greece, in
          Asia Minor, there were large communities, not of converted Jews
          only, but of proselytes from Gentiledom, who regarded themselves as
          constituting the Church of Christ. The existence of this fact is
          made patent by the Clementines and the Apostolic Constitutions. St.
          Peter's successors in the see of Rome have been a matter of
          perplexity. It has impressed itself on ecclesiastical students that
          Linus and Cletus ruled simultaneously. I have <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> little doubt it was so. The Judaizing
          Church was strong in Rome. Probably each of the two communities had
          its bishop set over it, one by Paul, the other by Peter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Catholic”</span> Church, the Church of the
          compromise, grew and prospered, and conquered the world, the narrow
          Judaizing Church dwindled till it expired, and with its expiration
          ceased conversion from Judaism. This Jewish Church retained to the
          last its close relationship with Mosaism. Circumstances, as has
          been shown, drew the Jewish believer and the Pharisee together.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Jerusalem
          fell, the Gentile Church passed without a shudder under the
          Bethlehem Gate, whereon an image of a swine had been set up in
          mockery; contemplated the statue of Hadrian on the site of the
          Temple without despair, and constituted itself under a Gentile
          bishop, Mark, in Ælia Capitolina.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the old
          Nazarene community, the Church of James and Symeon, clinging
          tightly to its old traditions, crouched in exile at Pella,
          confounded by the Romans in common banishment with the Jew. The
          guards thrust back Nazarene and Jew alike with their spears, when
          they ventured to approach the ruins of their prostrate city, the
          capital of their nation and of their faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Church at
          Jerusalem under Mark was, to the Nazarene, alien; its bishop an
          intruder. To the Nazarene, the memory of Paul was still hateful.
          The Clementine Recognitions speak of him with thinly-disguised
          aversion, and tell of a personal contest between him, when the
          persecutor Saul, and St. James their bishop, and of his throwing
          down stairs, and beating till nearly dead, the brother of the Lord.
          In the very ancient apocryphal letter of St. Peter to St. James,
          belonging to the same sect, and dating from the second century,
          Paul is spoken of as the <span class="tei tei-q">“enemy preaching a

          the temper of their minds and the colour of their belief. They
          represent St. James as the supreme head of the Church. He is

          curious collection of Homilies, Christianity is one with Judaism.
          It is a reform of Mosaism. It bears the relation to Judaism, that
          the Anglican Church of the last three centuries, it is pretended,
          bears to the Mediaeval Church in England. Everything essential was

          and written by Moses, was lost; it was found again after 300 years,
          lost again, and then re-written from memory by Ezra. Thus it came
          to pass that the Old Revelation went through various editions,
          which altered its meaning, and left it a compound of truths and
          errors.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href=

          the mark of a good and wise Jew, instructed by Jesus, to
          distinguish between what was true and what was false in the
          Scriptures.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          Nazarene thought himself a Hebrew of the Hebrews, as an Anglican
          esteems himself a better Catholic than the Catholics. The Nazarenes
          would have resented with indignation the imputation that they were
          a sect alien from the commonwealth of Israel, and, like all
          communities occupying an uneasy seat between two stools, were
          doubly, trebly vehement in their denunciation of that sect to which
          they were thought to bear some relation. They repudiated
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Christianity,”</span><a id="noteref_73"
          name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> as a
          high Anglican repudiates Protestantism; they held aloof from a
          Pauline believer, as an English Churchman will stand aloof from a
          Lutheran.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And thus it came
          to pass that the Jewish historians of the first century said
          nothing about Christ and the Church he founded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet St. Paul
          had wrought a work for Christ and the Church which, humanly
          speaking, none else could have effected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Nazarene
          Church was from its infancy prone to take a low view of the nature
          of Christ. The Jewish converts were so infected with Messianic
          notions that they could look on Jesus Christ only as the Messiah,
          not as incarnate God. They could see in him a prophet, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“one like unto Moses,”</span> but not one equal to the
          Father.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg
          039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The teaching of
          the apostles seemed powerless at the time to lift the faith of
          their Jewish converts to high views of the Lord's nature and
          mission. Their Judaic prejudice strangled, warped their faith.
          Directly the presence of the apostles was withdrawn, the restraint
          on this downward gravitation was removed, and Nazarenism settled
          into heresy on the fundamental doctrine of Christianity. To
          Gentiles it was in vain to preach Messianism. Messianism implied an
          earnest longing for a promised deliverer. Gentiles had no such
          longing, had never been led to expect a deliverer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostle must
          take other ground. He took that of the Incarnation, the Godhead
          revealing the Truth to mankind by manifestation of itself among
          men, in human flesh.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostles to
          the circumcision naturally appealed to the ruling religious passion
          in the Jewish heart—the passion of hope for the promised Messiah.
          The Messiah was come. The teaching of the apostles to the
          circumcision necessarily consisted of an explanation of this truth,
          and efforts to dissipate the false notions which coloured Jewish
          Messianic hopes, and interfered with their reception of the truth
          that Jesus was the one who had been spoken of by the prophets, and
          to whose coming their fathers had looked.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the Gentiles,
          St. Paul preached Christ as the revealer to a dark and ignorant
          world of the nature of God, the purpose for which He had made man,
          and the way in which man might serve and please God. The Jews had
          their revelation, and were satisfied with it. The Gentiles walked
          in darkness; they had none; their philosophies were the gropings of
          earnest souls after light. The craving of the Gentile heart was for
          a revelation. Paul preached to them the truth manifested to the
          world through Christ.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg
          040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus Pauline
          teaching on the Incarnation counteracted the downward drag of
          Nazarene Messianism, which, when left to itself, ended in denying
          the Godhead of Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If for a century
          the churches founded by St. Paul were sick with moral disorders,
          wherewith they were inoculated, the vitality of orthodox belief in
          the Godhead of Christ proved stronger than moral heresy, cast it
          out, and left only the scars to tell what they had gone through in
          their infancy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Petrine
          Christianity upheld the standard of morality, Pauline Christianity
          bore that of orthodoxy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. John, in the
          cool of his old age, was able to give the Church its permanent
          form. The Gentile converts had learned to reverence the purity, the
          uprightness, the truthfulness of the Nazarene, and to be ashamed of
          their excesses; and the Nazarene had seen that his Messianism
          supplied him with nothing to satisfy the inner yearning of his
          nature. Both met under the apostle of love to clasp hands and learn
          of one another, to confess their mutual errors, to place in the
          treasury of the Church, the one his faith, the other his ethics, to
          be the perpetual heritage of Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some there were
          still who remained fixed in their prejudices, self-excommunicated,
          monuments to the Church of the perils she had gone through, the
          Scylla and Charybdis through which she had passed with difficulty,
          guided by her Divine pilot.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have been
          obliged at some length to show that the early Christian Church in
          Palestine bore so close a resemblance to the Essene sect, that to
          the ordinary superficial observer it was indistinguishable from it.
          And also, that so broad was the schism separating the Nazarene
          Church consisting of Hebrews, from the Pauline Church consisting of
          Gentiles that no external observer <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> who had not examined the doctrines of these
          communities would suppose them to be two forms of the same faith,
          two religions sprung from the same loins. Their connection was as
          imperceptible to a Jew, as would be that between Roman Catholicism
          and Wesleyanism to-day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both Nazarene
          and Jew worshipped in the same temple, observed the same holy days,
          practised the same rites, shrank with loathing from the same food,
          and mingled their anathemas against the same apostate, Paul, who
          had cast aside at once the law in which he had been brought up, and
          the Hebrew name by which he had been known.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The silence of
          Josephus and Justus under these circumstances is explicable. They
          have described Essenism; that description covers Nazarenism as it
          appeared to the vulgar eye. If they have omitted to speak of Jesus
          and his death, it is because both wrote at the time when Nazarene
          and Pharisee were most closely united in sympathy, sorrow and
          regret for the past. It was not a time to rip up old wounds, and
          Justus and Josephus were both Pharisees.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That neither
          should speak of Pauline Christianity is also not remarkable. It was
          a Gentile religion, believed in only by Greeks and Romans; it had
          no open <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">observable</span></em> connection with
          Judaism. It was to them but another of those many religions which
          rose as mushrooms, to fade away again on the soil of the Roman
          world, with which the Jewish historians had little interest and no
          concern.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this
          explanation which I have offered is unsatisfactory, I know not
          whither to look for another which can throw light to the strange
          silence of Philo, Josephus and Justus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is thrown in
          the teeth of Christians, that history, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Christ; that the silence of contemporary, and all but contemporary,
          Jewish chroniclers, invalidates the testimony of the inspired
          records.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reasons
          which I have given seem to me to explain this silence plausibly,
          and to show that it arose, not from ignorance of the acts of Christ
          and the existence of the Church, but from a deliberate purpose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Celsus was one
          of the four first controversial opponents of Christianity. His book
          has been lost, with the exception of such portions as have been
          preserved by Origen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing for
          certain is known of Celsus. Origen endeavours to make him out to be
          an Epicurean, as prejudice existed even among the heathen against
          this school of philosophy, which denied, or left as open questions,
          the existence of a God, Providence, and the Eternity of the Soul.
          He says in his first book that he has heard there had existed two
          Epicureans of the name of Celsus, one who lived in the reign of
          Nero († A.D. 68), the other under Hadrian († A.D. 138), and it is
          with this latter that he has to do. But it is clear from passages
          of Celsus quoted by Origen, that this antagonist of Christianity
          was no Epicurean, but belonged to that school of Eclectics which
          based its teaching on Platonism, but adopted modifications from
          other schools. Origen himself is obliged to admit in several
          passages of his controversial treatise that the views of Celsus are
          not Epicurean, but Platonic; but he pretends that Celsus disguised
          his Epicureanism under a pretence of Platonism. Controversialists
          in the first days of Christianity were as prompt to discredit their
          opponents by ungenerous, false accusation, as in these later
          days.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We know neither
          the place nor the date of the birth of Celsus. That he lived later
          than the times of Hadrian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg
          044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          is clear from his mention of the Marcionites, who only arose in
          A.D. 142, and of the Marcellians, named after the woman Marcella,
          who, according to the testimony of Irenaeus,<a id="noteref_74"
          name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> first
          came to Rome in the time of Pope Anicetus, after A.D. 157. As
          Celsus in two passages remarks that the Christians spread their
          doctrines secretly, because they were forbidden under pain of death
          to assemble together for worship, it would appear that he wrote his
          book Λόγος ἀληθής during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (between
          161-180), who persecuted the Christians. We may therefore put the
          date of the book approximately at A.D. 176.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author is
          certainly the Celsus to whom Lucian dedicated his writing,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Alexander the False Prophet.”</span> Of
          the religious opinions of Celsus we are able to form a tolerable
          conception from the work of Origen. <span class="tei tei-q">“If the
          Christians only honoured One God,”</span> says he,<a id=
          "noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“then the weapons of their controversy with
          others would not be so weak; but they show to a man, who appeared
          not long ago, an exaggerated honour, and are of opinion that they
          are not offending the Godhead, when they show to one of His
          servants the same reverence that they pay to God Himself.”</span>
          Celsus acknowledges, with the Platonists, One only, eternal,
          spiritual God, who cannot be brought into union with impure matter,
          the world. All that concerns the world, he says, God has left to
          the dispensation of inferior spirits, which are the gods of
          heathendom. The welfare of mankind is at the disposal of these
          inferior gods, and men therefore do well to honour them in
          moderation; but the human soul is called to escape the chains of
          matter and strain after perfect purity; and this can only be done
          by meditation on the One, supreme, almighty God. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“God,”</span> says he,<a id="noteref_76" name=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“has <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class=

          affirm; for God has not either the appearance of a man, nor indeed
          any visible form.”</span> In the fourth Book he remarks, in
          opposition to the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will appeal to that which has been held
          as true in all ages,—that God is good, beautiful, blessed, and
          possesses in Himself all perfections. If He came down among men, He
          must have altered His nature; from a good God, He must have become
          bad; from beautiful, ugly; from blessed, unhappy; and His perfect
          Being would have become one of imperfection. Who can tolerate such
          a change? Only transitory things alter their conditions; the
          intransitory remain ever the same. Therefore it is impossible to
          conceive that God can have been transformed in such a
          manner.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is remarkable
          that Celsus, living in the middle of the second century, and able
          to make inquiries of aged Jews whose lives had extended from the
          first century, should have been able to find out next to nothing
          about Jesus and his disciples, except what he read in the Gospels.
          This is proof that no traditions concerning Jesus had been
          preserved by the Jews, apart from those contained in the Gospels,
          Canonical and Apocryphal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Origen's answer
          to Celsus is composed of eight Books. In the first Book a Jew
          speaks, who is introduced by Celsus as addressing Jesus himself; in
          the second Book this Jew addresses those of his fellow-countrymen
          who have embraced Christianity; in the other six Books Celsus
          speaks for himself. Origen extracts only short passages from the
          work of Celsus, and then labours to demolish the force of the
          argument of the opponent of Christianity as best he can.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The arguments of
          Celsus and the counter-arguments of Origen do not concern us here.
          All we have to deal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg
          046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          with are those traditions or slanders detailed to Celsus by the
          Jews, which he reproduces. That Celsus was in communication with
          Jews when he wrote the two first Books is obvious, and the only
          circumstances he relates which concern the life of our Lord he
          derived from his Jewish informants. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Jew (whom Celsus introduces) addresses Jesus, and finds much fault.
          In the first place, he charges him with having falsely proclaimed
          himself to be the Son of a Virgin; afterwards, he says that Jesus
          was born in a poor Jewish village, and that his mother was a poor
          woman of the country, who supported herself with spinning and
          needlework; that she was cast off by her betrothed, a carpenter;
          and that after she was thus rejected by her husband, she wandered
          about in disgrace and misery till she secretly gave birth to Jesus.
          Jesus himself was obliged from poverty and necessity to go down as
          servant into Egypt, where, he learnt some of the secret sciences
          which are in high honour among the Egyptians; and he placed such
          confidence in these sciences, that on his return to his native land
          he gave himself out to be a God.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Origen adds:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The carpenter, as the Jew of Celsus
          declares, who was betrothed to Mary, put the mother of Jesus from
          him, because she had broken faith with him, in favour of a soldier
          named Panthera!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Celsus relates from the Gospel of Matthew
          the flight of Christ into Egypt; but he denies all that is
          marvellous and supernatural in it, especially that an angel should
          have appeared to Joseph and ordered him to escape. Instead of
          seeking whether the departure of Jesus from Judaea and his
          residence in Egypt had not some spiritual meaning, he has made up a
          fable concerning it. He admits, indeed, that Jesus may have wrought
          the miracles which attracted such a multitude <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of people to him, and induced them to
          follow him as the Messiah; but he pretends that these miracles were
          wrought, not by virtue of his divine power, but of his magical
          knowledge. Jesus, says he, had a bad education; later he went into
          Egypt and passed into service there, and there learnt some
          wonderful arts. When he came back to his fatherland, on account of
          these arts, he gave himself out to be a God.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is most
          important evidence of the utter ignorance of the Jews in the second
          century of all that related to the history of our Lord. Justus and
          Josephus had been silent. There was no written narrative to which
          the Jew might turn for information; his traditions were silent. The
          fall of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jews had broken the
          thread of their recollections.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is very
          necessary to bear this in mind, in order to appreciate the utter
          worthlessness of the stories told of our Saviour in the Talmud and
          the Toledoth Jeschu. An attempt has been made to bolster up these
          late fables, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg
          048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is clear
          that the religious movement which our Lord originated in Palestine
          attracted much less attention at the time than has been usually
          supposed. The Sanhedrim at first regarded his teaching with the
          contempt with which, in after times, Leo X. heard of the preaching
          of Luther. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a schoolman's
          proposition,”</span> said the Pope. <span class="tei tei-q">“A new
          rabbinical tradition,”</span> the elders probably said. Only when
          their interests and fears were alarmed, did they interfere to
          procure the condemnation of Christ. And then they thought no more
          of their victim and his history than they did later of the history
          of James, the Lord's brother. The preaching and death of Jesus led
          to no tumultuous outbreak against the Roman government, and
          therefore excited little interest. The position of Christ as the
          God-man was not forced on them by the Nazarenes. The Jews noticed
          the virtues of these men, but ignored their peculiar tenets, till
          traditions were lost; and when the majesty of Christ, incarnate
          God, shone out on the world which turned to acknowledge him, they
          found that they had preserved no records, no recollections of the
          events in the history of Jesus. That he was said by Christians to
          have been born of a Virgin, driven into Egypt by King Herod—that he
          wrought miracles, gathered disciples, died on the cross and rose
          again—they heard from the Christians; and these facts they made use
          of to pervert them into fantastic fables, to colour them with
          malignant inventions. The only trace of independent tradition is in
          the mention made of Panthera by the Jew produced by
          Celsus.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It shows that in
          the fourth century the Jewish stories of Panthera had made such an
          impression on the Christians, that his name was forced into the

          the Jew with knowing nothing of Christ but what he had found out
          from the Gospels. He would not have uttered that taunt had any
          anti-Christian apocryphal biographies of Christ existed in his day.
          The Talmud, indeed, has the tale of Christ having studied magic in
          Egypt. Whence this legend, as well as that of Panthera, came, we
          shall see presently.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Talmud
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the Teaching) consists of
          two parts, the Mischna and the Gemara.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mischna
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> δευτέρωσις, Second Law, or
          Recapitulation) is a collection of religious ordinances,
          interpretations of Old Testament passages, especially of Mosaic
          rules, which have been given by various illustrious Rabbis from the
          date of the founding of the second Temple, therefore from about
          B.C. 400 to the year A.D. 200. These interpretations, which were
          either written or orally handed down, were collected in the year
          A.D. 219 by the Rabbi Jehuda the Holy, at Tiberias, on the Sea of
          Galilee, into a book to which he gave the name of Mischna, the
          Recapitulation of the Law. At that time the Jewish Sanhedrim and
          the Patriarch resided at Tiberias. After the destruction of
          Jerusalem in A.D. 70, the Sanhedrim, which consisted of seventy-one
          persons, assembled at Jamnia, the ancient Philistine city of Jabne;
          but on the insurrection of the Jews under Barcochab, A.D. 135, it
          took up its quarters at Tiberias. There the Sanhedrim met under a
          hereditary Patriarch of the family of Gamaliel, who bore the title
          of Nasi, Chief, till A.D. 420, when the last member of the house of
          Gamaliel died, and the Patriarchate and Sanhedrim departed from
          Tiberias.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mischna is
          made up of six Orders (Sedarim), which together contain sixty-three
          Tractates. The first Order or Seder is called Iesaïm, and treats of
          agriculture. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg
          051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          The second, Moed, treats of festivals. The third, Naschim, deals
          with the rights of women. The fourth, Nezikim, or Jechnoth, treats
          of cases of law. The fifth, Kodaschim, of holy things. The sixth,
          Taharoth, of impurity and purifications.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Orders of
          Kodaschim and Taharoth are incomplete. The Jerusalem Talmud
          consists of only the first four, and the tract Nidda, which belongs
          to the Order Taharoth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is
          deserving of remark, that many of the Rabbis whose sayings are
          recorded in the Mischna lived in the time of our Lord, or shortly
          after, and yet that not the smallest reference is made to the
          teaching of Jesus, nor even any allusion to him personally.
          Although the Mischna was drawn up beside the Sea of Galilee, at
          Tiberias, near where Jesus lived and wrought miracles and taught,
          neither he nor his followers are mentioned once throughout the
          Mischna.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There must be a
          reason why the Mischna, as well as Josephus and Justus of Tiberias,
          is silent respecting Jesus of Nazareth. The reason I have already
          given. The followers of Jesus were regarded as belonging to the
          sect of the Essenes. Our Lord's teaching made no great impression
          on the Jews of his time. It was so radically unlike the pedantry
          and puerilities of their Rabbis, that they did not acknowledge him
          as a teacher of the Law. He had preached Essene disengagement from
          the world, conquest of passion. Only when Essene enthusiasm was
          thought to threaten the powerful families which held possession of
          and abused the pontifical office, had the high-priest and his party
          taken alarm, and obtained the condemnation and death of Jesus.
          Their alarm died away, the political situation altered, the new
          Essenianism ceased to be suspected, and Nazarene Christianity took
          its place among the parties of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Judaism, attracting little notice and
          exciting no active hostility.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mischna was
          drawn up at the beginning of the third century, when Christianity
          was spreading rapidly through the Roman empire, and had excited the
          Roman emperors to fierce persecution of those who professed it. Yet
          Jehuda the Holy says not a word about Christ or Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He and those
          whose sayings he quotes had no suspicion that this religion, which
          was gaining ground every day among the Gentiles, had sprung from
          the teaching of a Jew. Christianity ruffled not the surface of
          Jewdom. The harmless Nazarenes were few, and were as strict
          observers of the Law as the straitest Pharisees.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And if
          Christianity was thus a matter of indifference to the Jews, no
          wonder that every recollection of Jesus of Nazareth, every
          tradition of his birth, his teaching, his death, had died away, so
          that, even at the close of the second century, Origen could charge
          his Jew opponent with knowing nothing of Jesus save what he had
          learned from the Gospels.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mischna
          became in turn the subject of commentary and interpretation by the
          Rabbis. The explanations of famous Rabbis, who taught on the
          Mischna, were collected, and called Gemara (the Complement),
          because with it the collection of rabbinical expositions of the Law
          was completed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two
          editions of the Gemara, one made in Palestine and called the
          Jerusalem Gemara, the other made at Babylon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jerusalem
          Gemara was compiled about A.D. 390, under the direction of the
          Patriarch of Tiberias. But there was a second Jewish Patriarchate
          at Babylon, which lasted till A.D. 1038, whereas that of Tiberias
          was extinguished, as has been already said, in A.D.
          420.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg
          053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          Babylonish Jews, under the direction of their Patriarch, an
          independent school of commentators on the Mischna had arisen. Their
          opinions were collected about the year A.D. 500, and compose the
          Babylonish Gemara. This latter Gemara is held by modern Jews in
          higher esteem than the Jerusalem Gemara.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mischna,
          which is the same to both Gemaras, together with one of the
          commentaries and glosses, called Mekilta and Massektoth, form
          either the Jerusalem or the Babylonish Talmud.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the Jewish
          historians who speak of the compilation of the Gemara of Babylon,
          are almost unanimous on three points: that the Rabbi Ashi was the
          first to begin the compilation, but that death interrupted him
          before its completion; that he had for his assistant another
          doctor, the Rabbi Avina; and that a certain Rabbi Jose finished the
          work seventy-three years after the death of Rabbi Ashi. Rabbi Ashi
          is believed to have died A.D. 427, consequently the Babylonish
          Talmud was completed in A.D. 500.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome (d.
          420) was certainly acquainted with the Mischna, for he mentions it
          by name.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=

          Andan or Annan, whom they call also Judas; and they maintain that
          the sons of Assamonaeus were the authors of the fourth. It is from
          these four sources that all those doctrines among them are derived,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this it
          appears that St. Ephraem was acquainted not only with the Mischna,
          but with the Gemara, then in process of formation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both the
          Jerusalem and the Babylonish Gemara, in their interpretations of
          the Mischna, mention Jesus and the apostles, or, at all events,
          have been supposed to do so. At the time when both Gemaras were
          drawn up, Christianity was the ruling religion in the Roman empire,
          and the Rabbis could hardly ignore any longer the Founder of the
          new religion. But their statements concerning Jesus are
          untrustworthy, because so late. Had they occurred in the Mischna,
          they might have deserved attention.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before we

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is a very
          curious story, and its appearance in the Talmud is somewhat
          difficult to understand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must now pass
          on to those passages which have been supposed to refer to our
          Lord.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          Babylonish Gemara<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=
          "#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> it is
          related that when King Alexander Jannaeus persecuted the Rabbis,
          the Rabbi Jehoshua, son of Parachias, fled with his disciple Jesus
          to Alexandria in Egypt, and there both received instruction in
          Egyptian magic. On their way back to Judaea, both were hospitably
          lodged by a woman. Next day, as Jehoshua and his disciple were
          continuing their journey, the master praised the hospitality of
          their hostess, whereupon his disciple remarked that she was not
          only a hospitable but a comely woman.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now as it was
          forbidden to Rabbis to look with admiration on female beauty, the
          Rabbi Jehoshua was so angry with his disciple, that he pronounced
          on him excommunication and a curse. Jesus after this separated from
          his master, and gave himself up wholly to the study of magic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name Jesus
          is Jehoshua Graecised. Both master <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and pupil in this legend bore the same name,
          but that of the pupil is in the Talmud abbreviated into Jeschu.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This story is
          introduced in the Gemara to illustrate the obligation incumbent on
          a Rabbi to keep custody over his eyes. It bears no signs of having
          been forced in so as to give expression to antipathy against
          Jeschu.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this Jeschu
          is our blessed Lord is by no means evident. On the contrary, the
          balance of probability is that the pupil of Jehoshua Ben Perachia
          was an entirely different person.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Jehoshua,
          son of Perachia, is a known historical personage. He was one of the
          Sanhedrim in the reign of Alexander Jannaeus. He began to teach as
          Rabbi in the year of the world 3606, or B.C. 154. Alexander
          Jannaeus, son of Hyrcanus, was king of the Jews in B.C. 106. The
          Pharisees could not endure that the royal and high-priestly
          functions should be united in the same person; they therefore broke
          out in revolt. The civil war caused the death of some 50,000,
          according to Josephus. When Alexander had suppressed the revolt, he
          led 800 prisoners to the fortress of Bethome, and crucified them
          before the eyes of his concubines at a grand banquet he gave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pharisees,
          and those of the Sanhedrim who had not fallen into his hands,
          sought safety in flight. It was then probably that Jehoshua, son of
          Perachia, went down into Egypt and was accompanied by Jeschu.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jehoshua was
          buried at Chittin, but the exact date of his death is not
          known.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=
          "#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexander
          Jannaeus died B.C. 79, after a reign of twenty-seven years, whilst
          besieging the castle of Ragaba on the further side of Jordan.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          at once that the date of the Talmudic <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Jeschu is something like a century earlier
          than that of the Jesus of the Gospels.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, it
          cannot be said that Jewish tradition asserts their identity. On the
          contrary, learned Jewish writers have emphatically denied that the
          Jeschu of the Talmud is the Jesus of the Gospels.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Disputation”</span> of the Rabbi Jechiels
          with Nicolas, a convert, occurs this statement. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This (which is related of Jesus and the Rabbi Joshua,
          son of Perachia) contains no reference to him whom Christians
          honour as a God;”</span> and then he points out that the
          impossibility of reconciling the dates is enough to prove that the
          disciple of Joshua Ben Perachia was a person altogether distinct
          from the Founder of Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rabbi
          Lippmann<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> gives
          the same denial, and shows that Jesus of the Gospels was a
          contemporary of Hillel, whereas the Jeschu of the anecdote lived
          from two to three generations earlier.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rabbi Salman
          Zevi entered into the question with great care in a pamphlet, and
          produced ten reasons for concluding that the Jeschu of the Talmud
          was not the Jesus, son of Mary, of the Evangelists.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can see now
          how it was that the Jew of Celsus brought against our Lord the
          charge of having learned magic in Egypt. He had heard in the
          Rabbinic schools the anecdote of Jeschu, pupil of Jehoshua, son of
          Perachia,—an anecdote which could scarcely fail to be narrated to
          all pupils. He at once concluded that this Jeschu was the Jesus of
          the Christians, without troubling himself with the chronology.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Mischna,
          Tract. Sabbath, fol. 104, it is forbidden to make marks upon the
          skin. The Babylonish Gemara <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> observes on this passage: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Did not the son of Stada mark the magical arts on his
          skin, and bring them with him out of Egypt?”</span> This son of
          Stada is Jeschu, as will presently appear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Mischna
          of Tract. Sanhedrim, fol. 43, it is ordered that he who shall be
          condemned to death by stoning shall be led to the place of
          execution with a herald going before him, who shall proclaim the
          name of the offender, and shall summon those who have anything to
          say in mitigation of the sentence to speak before the sentence is
          put in execution.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this the
          Babylonish Gemara remarks, <span class="tei tei-q">“There exists a
          tradition: On the rest-day before the Sabbath they crucified
          Jeschu. For forty days did the herald go before him and proclaim
          aloud, He is to be stoned to death because he has practised evil,
          and has led the Israelites astray, and provoked them to schism. Let
          any one who can bring evidence of his innocence come forward and
          speak! But as nothing was produced which could establish his
          innocence, he was crucified on the rest-day of the Passah
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the day before the
          Passover).”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mischna of
          Tract. Sanhedrim, fol. 67, treats of the command in Deut. xiii.
          6-11, that any Hebrew who should introduce the worship of other
          gods should be stoned with stones. On this the Gemara of Babylon
          relates that, in the city of Lydda, Jeschu was heard through a
          partition endeavouring to persuade a Jew to worship idols;
          whereupon he was brought forth and crucified on the eve of the
          Passover. <span class="tei tei-q">“None of those who are condemned
          to death by the Law are spied upon except only those (seducers of
          the people). How are they dealt with? They light a candle in an
          inner chamber, and place spies in an outer room, who may watch and
          listen to him (the accused). But he does not see them. Then he whom
          the accused had formerly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg
          059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          endeavoured to seduce says to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Repeat,
          I pray you, what you told me before in private.’</span> Then,
          should he do so, the other will say further, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘But how shall we leave our God in heaven and serve
          idols?’</span> Now should the accused be converted and repent at
          this saying, it is well; but if he goes on to say, That is our
          affair, and so and so ought we to do, then the spies must lead him
          off to the house of judgment and stone him. This is what was done
          to the son of Stada at Lud, and they hung him up on the eve of the
          Passover.”</span><a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=
          "#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          the Tract. Sanhedrim says, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is related
          that on the eve of the Sabbath they crucified Jeschu, a herald
          going before him,”</span> as has been already quoted; and then
          follows the comment: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ula said, Will you
          not judge him to have been the son of destruction, because he is a
          seducer of the people? For the Merciful says (Deut. xiii. 8), Thou
          shalt not spare him, neither shalt thou conceal him. But I, Jesus,
          am heir to the kingdom. Therefore (the herald) went forth
          proclaiming that he was to be stoned because he had done an evil
          thing, and had seduced the people, and led them into schism. And
          (Jeschu) went forth to be stoned with stones because he had done an
          evil thing, and had seduced the people and led them into
          schism.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Babylonish
          Gemara to the Mischna of Tract. Sabbath gives the following
          perplexing account of the parents of Jeschu:<a id="noteref_89"

          <span class="tei tei-q">“They stoned the son of Stada in Lud
          (Lydda), and crucified him on the eve of the Passover. This Stada's
          son was Pandira's son. Rabbi Chasda said Stada's husband was
          Pandira's master, namely Paphos, son of Jehuda. But how was Stada
          his mother? His (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Pandira's) mother was a
          woman's hair-dresser. As they say in Pombeditha (the Babylonish
          school by the Euphrates), this one went astray (S'tath-da) from her
          husband.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gloss or
          Paraphrase on this is: <span class="tei tei-q">“Stada's son was not
          the son of Paphos, son of Jehuda; No. As Rabbi Chasda observed,
          Paphos had a servant named Pandira. Well, what has that to do with
          it? Tell us how it came to pass that this son was born to Stada.
          Well, it was on this wise. Miriam, the mother of Pandira, used to
          dress Stada's hair, and ... Stada became a mother by Pandira, son
          of Miriam. As they say in Pombeditha, Stada by name and Stada by
          nature.”</span><a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The obscurity of
          the passage arises from various causes. R. Chasda is a punster, and
          plays on the double meaning of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Baal”</span> for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“husband”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“master.”</span> There is also ambiguity in the pronoun
          <span class="tei tei-q">“his;”</span> it is difficult to say to
          whom it always refers. The Paraphrase is late, and is a conjectural
          explanation of an obscure passage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear that
          the Jeschu of the Talmud was the son of one Stada and Pandira. But
          the name Pandira having the appearance of being a woman's
          name,<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=
          "#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> this
          led to additional confusion, for some said that Pandira was his
          mother's name.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The late Gloss
          does not associate Stada with the blessed Virgin. It gives the name
          of Miriam or Mary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg

          Celsus says that the mother of Jesus was a poor needlewoman, who
          also span for her livelihood. He probably recalled what was said of
          Miriam, the mother of Panthera, and grandmother of Jeschu, and
          applied it to St. Mary the Virgin, misled by the obscurity of the
          saying of Chasda, which was orally repeated in the Rabbinic

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is all that
          the Gemara tells us about Jeschu, son of Stada or Pandira. It
          behoves us now to consider whether he can have been the same person
          as our Lord.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That there
          really lived such a person as Jeschu Ben-Pandira, and that he was a
          disciple of the Rabbi Jehoshua Ben-Perachia, I see no reason to
          doubt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That he escaped
          from Alexander Jannaeus with his master into Egypt, and there
          studied magical arts; that he returned after awhile to Judaea, and
          practised his necromantic arts in his own country, is also not
          improbable. Somewhat later the Jews were famous, or infamous,
          throughout the Roman world as conjurors and exorcists. Egypt was
          the head-quarters of magical studies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That Jeschu, son
          of Pandira, was stoned to death, in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> accordance with the Law, for having practised
          magic, is also probable. The passages quoted are unanimous in
          stating that he was stoned for this offence. The Law decreed this
          as the death sorcerers were to undergo.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Talmud,
          Jeschu is first stoned and then crucified. The object of this
          double punishment being attributed to him is obvious. The Rabbis of
          the Gemara period had begun—like the Jew of Celsus—to confuse Jesus
          son of Mary with Jeschu the sorcerer. Their tradition told of a
          Jeschu who was stoned; Christian tradition, of a Jesus who was
          crucified. They combined the punishments and fused the persons into
          one. But this was done very clumsily. It is possible that more than
          one Jehoshua has contributed to form the story of Jeschu in the
          Talmud. For his mother Stada is said to have been married to
          Paphos, son of Jehuda. Now Paphos Ben-Jehuda is a Rabbi whose name
          recurs several times in the Talmud as an associate of the
          illustrious Rabbi Akiba, who lived after the destruction of
          Jerusalem, and had his school at Bene-Barah. To him the first
          composition of the Mischna arrangements is ascribed. As a follower
          of the pseudo-Messiah Barcochab, in the war of Trajan and Hadrian,
          he sealed a life of enthusiasm with a martyr's death, A.D. 135, at
          the capture of Bether. When the Jews were dispersed and forbidden
          to assemble, Akiba collected the Jews and continued instructing
          them in the Law. Paphus remonstrated with him on the risk. Akiba
          answered by a parable. <span class="tei tei-q">“A fox once went to
          the river side, and saw the fish flying in all directions. What do
          you fear? asked the fox. The nets spread by the sons of men,
          answered the fish. Ah, my friends, said the fox, come on shore by
          me, and so you will escape the nets that drag the water.”</span> A
          few days after, Akiba was in prison, and Paphus also. Paphus said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed art thou, Rabbi Akiba, because
          thou art imprisoned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg
          064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          for the words of the Law, and woe is me who am imprisoned for
          matters of no importance.”</span><a id="noteref_93" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We naturally
          wonder how it is that Stada, the mother of Jeschu, who was born
          about B.C. 120, should be represented as the wife of Paphus, son of
          Jehuda, who died about A.D. 150, two centuries and a half
          later.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is quite
          possible that this Paphus lost his wife, who eloped from him with
          one Pandira, and became mother of a son named Jehoshua. The name of
          Jehoshua or Jesus is common enough.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Gittin,
          Paphus is again mentioned. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is who
          finds a fly in his cup, and he takes it out, and will not drink of
          it. And this is what did Paphus Ben-Jehuda, who kept the door shut
          upon his wife, and nevertheless she ran away from
          him.”</span><a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=

          to her, My daughter, if you will tell me the truth I will promise

          his lips, but in his heart he did not ratify the oath.”</span> Then

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have here
          corroborative evidence that this Stada and her son Jeschu lived at
          the time of Akiba and Paphus, that is, after the fall of Jerusalem,
          in the earlier part of the second century.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I think that
          probably the story grew up thus:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A certain
          Jehoshua, in the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, went down into Egypt,
          and there learnt magic. He returned to Judaea, where he practised
          it, but was arrested at Lydda and executed by order of the
          Sanhedrim, by being stoned to death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But who was this
          Jehoshua? Tradition was silent. However, there was a floating
          recollection of a Jehoshua born of one Stada, wife of Paphus, son
          of Jehuda, the companion of Akiba. The two Jehoshuas were
          confounded together. Thus stood the story when Origen wrote against
          Celsus in A.D. 176.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By A.D. 500 it
          had grown considerably. The Jew of Celsus had already fused Jesus
          of Nazareth with the other two Jehoshuas. This led to the Rabbis of
          the Gemara relating that Jehoshua was both stoned and
          crucified.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not say
          that this certainly is the origin of the story as it appears in the
          Talmud, but it bears on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> face of it strong likelihood that it is.
          Jehoshua who went into Egypt could not have been stoned to death
          after the destruction of Jerusalem and the revolt of Barcochab, for
          then the Jews had not the power of life and death in their hands.
          The execution must have taken place long before; yet the Rabbis
          whose names appear in connection with the story—always excepting
          Jehoshua son of Perachia—all belong to the second century after
          Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The solution I
          propose is simple, and it explains what otherwise would be
          inexplicable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it be a true
          solution, it proves that the Jews in A.D. 500, when the Babylonian
          Gemara was completed, had no traditions whatever concerning Jesus
          of Nazareth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall see
          next how the confusion that originated in the Talmud grew into the
          monstrous romance of the Toledoth Jeschu, the Jewish counter-Gospel
          of the Middle Ages.</p>

          lest the sight of it should excite tumults, spoliation and
          massacre. But of the fact of its existence Christians were made
          aware by the account of converts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are, in

          hardly be believed in presence of the silence of Josephus and
          Justus, and the ignorance of the Jew of Celsus. Origen says in his
          answer, that <span class="tei tei-q">“though innumerable lies and
          calumnies had been forged against the venerable Jesus, none had
          dared to charge him with any intemperance whatever.”</span><a id=

          speaks confidently, with full assurance. If he had ever met with
          such a calumny, he would not have denied its existence, he would
          have set himself to work to refute it. Had such calumnious writings
          existed, Origen would have been sure to know of them. We may
          therefore be quite satisfied that none such existed in his time,
          the middle of the third century.</p>

          you believe as a Christian that Christ is the Son of God. Next he
          mocks us, all Christendom, in that we believe in such a Son of God.
          Thirdly, he mocks his own fellow Jews, telling them such
          disgraceful, foolish, senseless affairs, as of brazen dogs and
          cabbage-stalks and such like, enough to make all dogs bark
          themselves to death, if they could understand it, at such a pack of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two
          versions of the Toledoth Jeschu, differing widely from one another.
          The first was published by Wagenseil, of Altdorf, in 1681. The
          second by Huldrich at Leyden in 1705. Neither can boast of an
          antiquity greater than, at the outside, the twelfth century. It is
          difficult to say with certainty which is the earlier of the two.
          Probably both came into use about the same time; the second
          certainly in Germany, for it speaks of Worms in the German
          empire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          first, Jeschu (Jesus) was born in the year of the world 4671 (B.C.
          910), in the reign of Alexander <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Jannaeus (B.C. 106-79)! He was the son of
          Joseph Pandira and Mary, a widow's daughter, the sister of
          Jehoshua, who was affianced to Jochanan, disciple of Simeon Ben
          Schetah; and Jeschu became the pupil of the Rabbi Elchanan. Mary is
          of the tribe of Juda.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          second, Jeschu was born in the reign of Herod the Proselyte, and
          was the son of Mary, daughter of Calpus, and sister of Simeon, son
          of Calpus, by Joseph Pandira, who carried her off from her husband,
          Papus, son of Jehuda. Jeschu was brought up by Joshua, son of
          Perachia, in the days of the illustrious Rabbi Akiba! Mary is of
          the tribe of Benjamin.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The anachronisms
          of both accounts are so gross as to prove that they were drawn up
          at a very late date, and by Jews singularly ignorant of the
          chronology of their history.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first,
          Mary is affianced to Jochanan, disciple of Simeon Ben Schetah. Now
          Schimon or Simeon, son of Scheta, is a well-known character. He is
          said to have strangled eighty witches in one day, and to have been
          the companion of Jehudu Ben Tabai. He flourished B.C. 70.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the second
          life we hear of Mary being the sister of Simeon Ben Kalpus
          (Chelptu). He also is a well-known Rabbi, of whom many miracles are
          related. He lived in the time of the Emperor Antoninus, before whom
          he stood as a disciple, when an old man (circ. A.D. 160).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this also the
          Rabbi Akiba is introduced. Akiba died A.D. 135. Also the Rabbi
          Jehoshua Ben Levi. Now this Rabbi's date can also be fixed with
          tolerable accuracy. He was the teacher of the Rabbi Jochanan, who
          compiled the Jerusalem Talmud. His date is A.D.
          220.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
          Toledoth Jeschu closes with, <span class="tei tei-q">“These are the
          words of Jochanan Ben Zaccai;”</span> but it is not clear whether
          it is intended that the book should be included in <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The words of Jochanan,”</span> or whether the
          reference is only to a brief sentence preceding this statement,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore have they no part or lot in
          Israel. The Lord bless his people Israel with peace.”</span>
          Jochanan Ben Zaccai was a priest and ruler of Israel for forty
          years, from A.D. 30 or 33 to A.D. 70 or 73. He died at Jamnia, near
          Jerusalem (Jabne of the Philistines), and was buried at
          Tiberias.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor are these
          anachronisms the only proofs of the ignorance of the composers of
          the two anti-evangels. In the first, on the death of King Alexander
          Jannaeus, the government falls into the hands of his wife Helena,
          who is represented as being <span class="tei tei-q">“also called
          Oleina, and was the mother of King Mumbasius, afterwards called
          Hyrcanus, who was killed by his servant Herod.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wife of
          Alexander Jannaeus was Alexandra, not Helena; she reigned from B.C.
          79 to B.C. 71. She was the mother of Hyrcanus and Aristobulus; but
          was quite distinct from Oleina, mother of Mumbasius, and Mumbasius
          was a very different person from Hyrcanus. Oleina was a queen of
          Adiabene in Assyria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first Life

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both give absurd
          anecdotes to account for monks wearing shaven crowns; both reasons
          are different.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
          Life, the Christian festivals of the Ascension <span class=

          Christmas, and the Circumcision <span class="tei tei-q">“eight days
          after,”</span> are spoken of as institutions of the Christian
          Church.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the VIIIth
          Book of the Apostolical Constitutions, the festivals of the
          Nativity and the Ascension are spoken of,<a id="noteref_104" name=

          consequently they must have been kept holy from a very early age.
          But it was not so with the feast of the Circumcision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The 1st of
          January was a great day among the heathen. In the Homilies of the
          Fathers down to the eighth century, the 1st of January is called
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Feast of Satan and Hell,”</span> and
          the faithful are cautioned against observing it. All participation
          in the festivities of that day was forbidden by the Council
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in Trullo,”</span> in A.D. 692, and again
          in the Council of Rome, A.D. 744.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pope Gelasius
          (A.D. 496) forbade all observance of the day, according to
          Baronius<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href=
          "#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a>, in
          the hope of rooting out every remembrance of the pagan ceremonies
          which were connected with it. In ancient Sacramentaries is a mass
          on this day, <span class="tei tei-q">“de prohibendo ab
          idolis.”</span> Nevertheless, traces of the celebration of the
          Circumcision of Christ occur in the fourth century; for Zeno,
          Bishop of Verona (d. A.D. 380), preached a sermon on it. In the
          ancient Mozarabic Kalendar, in the Martyrology wrongly attributed
          to St. Jerome, and in the Gelasian Sacramentary, the Circumcision
          is indicated on January 1. But though noted in the Kalendars, the
          day was, for the reason of its being observed as a heathen
          festival, not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg
          073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          treated by the Church as a festival till very late. Litanies and
          penitential offices were appointed for it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The notice in
          the Toledoth Jeschu, therefore, points to a time when the feast was
          observed with outward demonstration of joy, and the sanction of the
          Church accorded to other festivities.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Toledoth
          Jeschu adopts the fable of the Sanhedrim and King having sent out
          an account of the trial of Jesus to the synagogues throughout the
          world to obtain from them an expression of opinion. The synagogue
          of Worms remonstrated against the execution of Christ. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The people of Girmajesa (Germany) and all the
          neighbouring country round Girmajesa which is now called Wormajesa
          (Worms), and which lies in the realm of the Emperor, and the little
          council in the town of Wormajesa, answered the King (Herod) and
          said, Let Jesus go, and slay him not! Let him live till he falls
          and perishes of his own accord.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The synagogues
          of several cities in the Middle Ages did in fact, produce
          apocryphal letters which they pretended had been written by their
          forefathers remonstrating with the Jewish Sanhedrim at Jerusalem,
          and requesting that Jesus might be spared. An epistle was produced
          by the Jews of Ulm in A.D. 1348, another by the Jews of Ratisbon
          about the same date, from the council at Jerusalem to their
          synagogues.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href=
          "#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> The
          Jews of Toledo pretended to possess similar letters in the reign of
          Alfonso the Valiant, A.D. 1072. These letters probably served to
          protect them from feeling the full stress of persecution which
          oppressed the Jews elsewhere.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          astonishing ignorance of Gospel accounts of Christ and the apostles
          is observable in both anti-evangels. Matthias and Matthew are the
          same, so are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg

          John the Baptist and John the Apostle, whilst Thaddaeus is said to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are
          instances of the confusion of times and persons into which these
          counter-Gospels have fallen, and they are sufficient to establish
          their late and worthless character.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two
          anti-Gospels are clearly not two editions of an earlier text. The
          only common foundation on which both were constructed was the
          mention of Jeschu, son of Panthera, in the Talmud. Add to this such
          distorted versions of Gospel stories as circulated among the Jews
          in the Middle Ages, and we have the constituents of both
          counter-Gospels. Both exhibit a profound ignorance of the sacred
          text, but a certain acquaintance with prominent incidents in the
          narrative of the Evangelists, not derived directly from the
          Gospels, but, as I believe, from miracle-plays and pictorial and
          sculptured representations such as would meet the eye of a
          mediaeval Jew at every turn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have not to
          cast about far for a reason which shall account for the production
          of these anti-evangels.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The persecution
          to which the Jews were subjected in the Middle Ages from the
          bigotry of the rabble or the cupidity of princes, fanned their
          dislike for Christianity into a flame of intense mortal abhorrence
          of the Founder of that religion whose votaries were their deadliest
          foes. The Toledoth Jeschu is the utterance of this deep-seated
          hatred,—the voice of an oppressed people execrating him who had
          sprung from the holy race, and whose blood was weighing on their
          heads.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And it is not
          improbable that the Gospel record of the patient, loving life of
          Jesus may have exerted an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
          075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          influence on the young who ventured, with the daring curiosity of
          youth, to explore those peaceful pages. What answer had the Rabbis
          to make to those of their own religion who were questioning and
          wavering? They had no counter-record to oppose to the Gospels, no
          tradition wherewith to contest the history written by the
          Evangelists. The notices in the Talmud were scanty, incomplete. It
          was open to dispute whether these notices really related to Christ
          Jesus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under such
          circumstances, a book which professed to give a true account of
          Jesus was certain to be hailed and accepted without too close a
          scrutiny as to its authenticity; much as in the twelfth century
          Joseph Ben Gorion's <span class="tei tei-q">“Jewish War”</span> was
          assumed to be authentic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Toledoth
          Jeschu or <span class="tei tei-q">“Birth of Jesus”</span> boldly
          identified the Jesus of the Gospels with the Jeschu of the Talmud,
          and attempted to harmonize the Rabbinic and the Christian
          stories.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          certain likeness between the two counter-Gospels, but this arises
          solely from each author being actuated by the same motives as the
          other, and from both deriving from common sources,—the Talmud and
          Jewish misrepresentations of Gospel events.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if there be
          a likeness, there is sufficient dissimilarity to make it evident
          that the two authors wrote independently, and had no common written
          text to amplify and adorn.</p>

          "font-size: 90%">In the year of the world 4671, in the days of King
          Jannaeus, a great misfortune befel Israel. There arose at that time
          a scape-grace, a wastrel and worthless fellow, of the fallen race
          of Judah, named Joseph Pandira. He was a well-built man, strong and
          handsome, but he spent his time in robbery and violence. His
          dwelling was at Bethlehem, in Juda. And there lived near him a
          widow with her daughter, whose name was Mirjam; and this is the
          same Mirjam who dressed and curled women's hair, who is mentioned
          several times in the Talmud.</span><span style=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is remarkable
          that the author begins with the very phrase found in Josephus. He
          calls the appearance of our Lord <span class="tei tei-q">“a great
          misfortune which befel Israel.”</span> Josephus, after the passage
          which has been intruded into his text relative to the miracles and
          death of Christ, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“About this time
          another great misfortune set the Jews in commotion;”</span> from
          which it appears as if Josephus regarded the preaching of Christ as
          a great misfortune. That he made no such reference has been already
          shown.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
          077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author also
          places the birth of Jesus, in accordance with the Talmud, in the
          reign of Alexander Jannaeus, who reigned from B.C. 106 to B.C. 79.
          He reckons from the creation of the world, and gives the year as
          4671 (B.C. 910). This manner of reckoning was only introduced among
          the Jews in the fourth century after Christ, and did not become
          common till the twelfth century.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Wagenseil
          Toledoth goes on to say that the widow engaged Mirjam to an
          amiable, God-fearing youth, named Jochanan (John), a disciple of
          the Rabbi Simeon, son of Shetach (fl. B.C. 70); but he went away to
          Babylon, and she became the mother of Jeschu by Joseph Pandira. The
          child was named Joshua, after his uncle, and was given to the Rabbi
          Elchanan to be instructed in the Law.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day Jeschu,
          when a boy, passed before the Rabbi Simeon Ben Shetach and other
          members of the Sanhedrim without uncovering his head and bowing his
          knee. The elders were indignant. Three hundred trumpets were blown,
          and Jeschu was excommunicated and cast out of the Temple. Then he
          went away to Galilee, and spent there several years.</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

          engraved in the Temple on the corner-stone. For when King David dug
          the foundations, he found there a stone in the ground on which the
          Name of God was engraved, and he took it and placed it in the Holy
          of Holies.</span></span></p>

            which they set before the entrance to the Holy of Holies, one on
            the right, the other on the left.</span></span></p>

            that, out of alarm and bewilderment, he would lose his presence
            of mind and forget the Name.</span></span></p><span class=

            to Jerusalem, and went into the Temple and learned there the holy
            writing; and after he had written the incommunicable Name on
            parchment, he uttered it, with intent that he might feel no pain,
            and then he cut into his flesh, and hid the parchment with its
            inscription therein. Then he uttered the Name once more, and made
            so that his flesh healed up again.</span></span></p>

            town, cut into his flesh, took the writing out, and when he had
            sufficiently studied the signs he retained the Name in his
            memory.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is scarcely
          necessary here to point out the amazing ignorance of the author of
          the Toledoth Jeschu in making David the builder of the Temple, and
          in placing the images of lions at the entrance to the Holy of
          Holies. The story is introduced because Jeschu, son of Stada, in
          the Talmud is said to have made marks on his skin. But the author
          knew his Talmud very imperfectly. The Babylonian Gemara says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Did not the son of Stada mark the magical
          arts on his skin, and bring them with him out of Egypt?”</span> The
          story in the Talmud which accounted for the power of Jeschu to work
          miracles was quite different from that in the Toledoth Jeschu. In
          the Talmud he has power by bringing out of Egypt, secretly cut on
          his skin, the magic arts there privately taught; in the Toledoth he
          acquires his power by learning the incommunicable Name and hiding
          it under his flesh.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, the
          author says, <span class="tei tei-q">“He could not have penetrated
          into the Holy of Holies without the aid of magic; for how would the
          holy priests and followers of Aaron have suffered him to enter
          there? This must certainly have been done by the aid of
          magic.”</span> But the author gives no account of how Jeschu
          learned magic. That <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg
          079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          we ascertain from the Huldrich text, where we are told that Jeschu
          spent many years in Egypt, the head-quarters of those who practised
          magic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having acquired
          this knowledge, Jeschu went into Galilee and proclaimed himself to
          have been the creator of the world, and born of a virgin, according
          to the prophecy of Isaiah (vii. 14). As a sign of the truth of his
          mission, he said:</p>

            greatly; but the elders, the pious men, and the company of the

          further, it is advisable to make a few remarks on what has been
          given of this curious story.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Queen Helena
          is probably the mother of Constantine, who went to Jerusalem in
          A.D. 326 to see the holy sites, and, according to an early legend,
          discovered the three crosses on Calvary. There are several
          incidents in the apocryphal story which bear a resemblance to the
          incidents in the Toledoth Jeschu.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Empress
          Helena favours the Christians against the Jews. Where three crosses
          are found, a person suffering from <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          grievous and incurable disease”</span> is applied to the crosses,
          and recovers on touching the true one. Then the same experiment is
          tried with a dead body, with the same success.<a id="noteref_111"
          name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>
          According to the Apocryphal Acts of St. Cyriacus, a Jew named Judas
          was brought before the Empress, and ordered to point out where the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name=
          "Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cross was buried.
          Judas resisted, but was starved in a well till he revealed the
          secret. The resemblance between the stories consists in the names
          of Helena and Judas, and the miracles of healing a leper, and
          raising a dead man to life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          Apocryphal Acts of St. Cyriacus, Judas was the grandson of
          Zacharias, and nephew of St. Stephen the protomartyr.<a id=
          "noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is remarkable
          that Jeschu should be made to quote two passages in the Psalms as
          prophecies of himself, both of which are used in this manner in the
          New Testament: Ps. ii. 7, in Acts xiii. 33, and again Heb. i. 5,
          and v. 5; and Ps. cx. 1, in St. Matthew xxii. 44, and the
          corresponding passages in St. Mark and St. Luke; also in Acts ii.
          34, in 1 Cor. xv. 25, and Heb. i. 13.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scene of the
          struggle in the air is taken from the contest of St. Peter with
          Simon Magus, and reminds one of the contest in the Arabian Nights
          between the Queen of Beauty and the Jin in the story of the Second
          Calender.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The putting
          forth from land on a millstone on the occasion of the miraculous
          draught of fishes is probably a perversion of the incident of Jesus
          entering into the boat of Peter—the stone—before the miracle was
          performed, according to St. Luke, v. 1-8. In the Toledoth Jeschu
          there are two millstones which our Lord sets afloat, and he mounts
          one, and then the fishes are caught; in St. Luke's Gospel there are
          two boats.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was standing
          on the swimming-stone, according to the Huldrich version, that
          Jeschu preached to the people, and declared to them his divine
          mission.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The story goes
          on. The Sanhedrim, fearing to allow Jeschu to remain at liberty,
          send Judas after him to Jordan. Judas pronounces a great
          incantation, which obliges the Angel of Sleep to seal the eyes of
          Jeschu and his disciples. Then, whilst they sleep, he comes and
          cuts from the arm of Jeschu a scrap of parchment on which the Name
          of Jehovah is written, and which was concealed under the flesh.
          Jeschu awakes, and a spirit appears to him and vexes him sore. Then
          he feels that his power is gone, and he announces to his disciples
          that his hour is come when he must be taken by his enemies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The disciples,
          amongst whom is Judas, who unobserved, has mingled with them, are
          sorely grieved; but Jeschu encourages them, and bids them believe
          in him, and they will obtain thrones in heaven. Then he goes with
          them to the Paschal Feast, in hopes of again being able to
          penetrate into the Holy of Holies, and reading again the
          incommunicable Name, and of thus recovering his power. But Judas
          forewarns the elders, and as Jeschu enters the Temple he is
          attacked by armed men. The Jewish servants do not know Jeschu from
          his disciples. Accordingly Judas flings himself down before him,
          and thus indicates whom they are to take. Some of the disciples
          offer resistance, but are speedily overcome, and take to flight to
          the mountains, where they are caught and executed.</p>

            wept and said, My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me? And the
            elders said, If thou be God, save thyself from our hands. But
            Jeschu answered, saying, My blood is shed for the redemption of
            the world, for Isaiah prophesied of me, He was wounded for our
            transgression and bruised for our iniquities; our chastisement
            lies upon him that we may have peace, and by his wounds we are

            <span style="font-size: 90%">Then they led Jeschu forth before
            the greater and the lesser Sanhedrim, and he was sentenced to be
            stoned, and then to be hung on a tree. And it was the eve of the
            Passover and of the Sabbath. And they led him forth to the place
            where the punishment of stoning was wont to be executed, and they
            stoned him there till he was dead. And after that, the wise men
            hung him on the tree; but no tree would bear him; each brake and
            yielded. And when even was come the wise men said, We may not, on
            account of the Fatherless, break the letter of the law (which
            forbids that one who is hung should remain all night on the
            tree). Though he may have set at naught the law, yet will not we.
            Therefore they buried the Fatherless in the place where he was
            stoned. And when, midnight was come, the disciples came and
            seated themselves on the grave, and wept and lamented him. Now
            when Judas saw this, he took the body away and buried it in his
            garden under a brook. He diverted the water of the brook
            elsewhere; but when the body was laid in its bed, he brought its

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Christians
          promised to do as Cephas commanded them, but they desired him to
          reside in the midst of them in their great city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this he
          consented. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will dwell with you,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“if ye will promise to permit me
          to abstain from all food, and to eat only the bread of poverty and
          drink the water of affliction. Ye must also build me a tower in the
          midst of the city, wherein I may spend the rest of my
          days.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was done.
          The tower was built and called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peter,”</span> and in this Cephas dwelt till his death
          six years after. <span class="tei tei-q">“In truth, he served the
          God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and composed many
          beautiful hymns, which he dispersed among the Jews, that they might
          serve as a perpetual memorial of him; and he divided all his hymns
          among the Rabbis of Israel.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On his death he
          was buried in the tower.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After his death,
          a man named Elias assumed the place of messenger of Jeschu, and he
          declared that Simon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg
          092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Cephas had deceived the Christians, and that he, Elias, was an
          apostle of Jeschu, rather than Cephas, and that the Christians
          should follow him. The Christians asked for a sign.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Elias said
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What sign do ye ask?”</span> Then a stone
          fell from the tower Peter, and smote him that he died. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thus,”</span> concludes this first version of the
          Toledoth Jeschu, <span class="tei tei-q">“may all Thine enemies
          perish, O Lord; but may those that love Thee be as the sun when it
          shineth in its strength!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus ends this
          wonderful composition, which carries its own condemnation with
          it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two captures
          and sentences of Jeschu are apparently two forms of Jewish legend
          concerning Christ's death, which the anonymous writer has clumsily
          combined.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scene in
          Gethsemane is laid on the other side of Jordan. It is manifestly
          imitated from the Gospels, but not directly, probably from some
          mediaeval sculptured representation of the Agony in the Garden,
          common outside every large church.<a id="noteref_119" name=
          "noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          place of an angel appearing to comfort Christ, an evil spirit vexes
          him. The kiss of Judas is transformed into a genuflexion or
          prostration before him, and takes place, not in the Garden but in
          the Temple. The resistance of the disciples is mentioned. Jeschu is
          bound to a marble pillar and scourged. Of this the Gospels say
          nothing; but the pillar is an invariable feature in artistic
          representations of the scourging. Two of the sayings on the Cross
          are correctly given. In agreement with the account in the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name=
          "Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Talmud, Jeschu is
          stoned, and then, to identify the son of Panthera with the son of
          Mary, is hung on a tree. The tree breaks, and he falls to the
          ground. The visitor to Oberammergau Passion Play will remember the
          scene of Judas hanging himself, and the tree snapping. The Toledoth
          Jeschu does not say that Jeschu was crucified, but that he was
          hung. The suicide of Judas was identified with the death of Jesus.
          If the author of the anti-evangel saw the scene of the breaking
          bough in a miracle-play, he would perhaps naturally transfer it to
          Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The women seated
          late at night by the sepulchre, or coming early with spices, a
          feature in miracle-plays of the Passion, are transformed into the
          disciples weeping above the grave. The angel who addresses them, in
          the Toledoth Jeschu, becomes Judas.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In
          miracle-plays, Claudia Procula, the wife of Pilate, assumes a
          prominence she does not occupy in the Gospels; she may have
          originated the idea in the mind of the author of Wagenseil's
          Toledoth, of the Queen Helena. That he confounded the Queen of King
          Jannaeus with the mother of Constantine is not wonderful. The
          latter was the only historical princess who showed sympathy with
          the Christians at Jerusalem, and of whose existence the anonymous
          author was aware, probably through the popular mediaeval romance of
          Helena, <span class="tei tei-q">“La belle Helène.”</span> He
          therefore fell without a struggle into the gross anachronism of
          making the Empress Helena the wife of Jannaeus, and contemporary
          with Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Toledoth
          Jeschu of Wagenseil, Simon Peter is represented as a Jew ruling the
          Christians in favour of the Jews. The Papacy must have been fully
          organized when this anti-evangel was written, and the Jews must
          have felt the protection accorded them by the Popes <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> against their persecutors. St. Gregory
          the Great wrote letters, in 591 and 598, in behalf of the Jews who
          were maltreated in Italy and Sicily. Alexander II., in 1068, wrote
          a letter to the Bishops of Gaul exhorting them to protect the Jews
          against the violence of the Crusaders, who massacred them on their
          way to the East. He gave as his reason for their protection the
          very one put into Simon Cephas' mouth in the Toledoth Jeschu, that
          God had preserved them and scattered them in all countries as
          witnesses to the truth of the Gospel. In the cruel confiscation of
          their goods, and expulsion from France by Philip Augustus, and the
          simultaneous persecution they underwent in England, Innocent III.
          took their side, and insisted, in 1199, on their being protected
          from violence. Gregory IX. defended them when maltreated in Spain
          and in France by the Crusaders in 1236, on their appeal to him for
          protection. In 1246, the Jews of Germany appealed to the Pope,
          Innocent IV., against the ecclesiastical and secular princes who
          pillaged them on false charges. Innocent wrote, in 1247, ordering
          those who had wronged them to indemnify them for their losses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1417, the
          Jews of Constance came to meet Martin V., as their protector, on
          his coronation, with hymns and torches, and presented him with the
          Pentateuch, which he had the discourtesy to refuse, saying that
          they might have the Law, but they did not understand it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The claim made
          in the Toledoth Jeschu that the Papacy was a government in the
          interest of the Jews against the violence of the Christians, points
          to the thirteenth century as the date of the composition of this
          book, a century when the Jews suffered more from Christian
          brutality than at any other period, when their exasperation against
          everything Christian was wrought to its highest pitch, and when
          they found the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
          095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Chair of Peter their only protection against extermination by the
          disciples of Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some dim
          reference may be made to the anti-pope of Jewish blood, Peter
          Leonis, who took the name of Anacletus II., and who survives in
          modern Jewish legend as the Pope Elchanan. Anacletus II. (A.D.
          1130-1138) maintained his authority in Rome against Innocent II.,
          and from his refuge in the tower of St. Angelo, defied the Emperor
          Lothair, who had marched to Rome to install Innocent. Anacletus was
          accused of showing favour to the Jews, whose blood he inherited—his
          father was a Jewish usurer. When Christians shrank from robbing the
          churches of their silver and golden ornaments, required by
          Anacletus to pay his mercenaries and bribe the venal Romans, he is
          said to have entrusted the odious task to the Jews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jewish legend
          has converted the Jewish anti-pope into the son of the Rabbi Simeon
          Ben Isaac, of Mainz, who died A.D. 1096. According to the story,
          the child Elchanan was stolen from his father and mother by a
          Christian nurse, was taken charge of by monks, grew up to be
          ordained priest, and finally was elected Pope.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a child he
          had been wont to play chess with his father, and had learned from
          him a favourite move whereby to check-mate his adversary.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jews of
          Germany suffered from oppression, and appointed the Rabbi Simeon to
          bear their complaints to the Pope. The old Jew went to Rome and was
          introduced to the presence of the Holy Father. Elchanan recognized
          him at once, and sent forth all his attendants, then proposed a
          game of chess with the Rabbi. When the Pope played the favourite
          move of the old Jew, Simeon Ben Isaac sprang up, smote his brow,
          and cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought none knew this
          move save I and my long-lost child.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am that child,”</span> answered the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Pope, and he flung himself into the
          arms of the aged Jew.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href=
          "#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
          Wagenseil Toledoth Jeschu was written in the eleventh, twelfth or
          thirteenth century appears probable from the fact stated, that it
          was in these centuries that the Jews were more subjected to
          persecution, spoliation and massacre than in any other; and the
          Toledoth Jeschu is the cry of rage of a tortured people,—a curse
          hurled at the Founder of that religion which oppressed them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the eleventh
          century the Jews in the great Rhine cities were massacred by the
          ferocious hosts of Crusaders under Ernico, Count of Leiningen, and
          the priests Folkmar and Goteschalk. At the voice of their leaders
          (A.D. 1096), the furious multitude of red-crossed pilgrims spread
          through the cities of the Rhine and the Moselle, massacring
          pitilessly all the Jews that they met with in their passage. In
          their despair, a great number preferred being their own destroyers
          to awaiting certain death at the hands of their enemies. Several
          shut themselves up in their houses, and perished amidst flames
          their own hands had kindled; some attached heavy stones to their
          garments, and precipitated themselves and their treasures into the
          Rhine or Moselle. Mothers stifled their children at the breast,
          saying that they preferred sending them to the bosom of Abraham to
          seeing them torn away to be nurtured in a religion which bred
          tigers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          ecclesiastics behaved with Christian humanity. The Bishops of Worms
          and Spires ran some risk in saving as many as they could of this
          defenceless people. The Archbishop of Treves, less generous, gave
          refuge to such only as would consent to receive baptism, and coldly
          consigned the rest to the knives and halters <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Christian fanatics. The
          Archbishop of Mainz was more than suspected of participation in the
          plunder of his Jewish subjects. The Emperor took on himself the
          protection and redress of the wrongs endured by the Jews, and it
          was apparently at this time that the Jews were formally taken under
          feudal protection by the Emperor. They became his men, owing to him
          special allegiance, and with full right therefore to his
          protection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Toledoth
          Jeschu of Wagenseil was composed by a German Jew; that is apparent
          from its mention of the letter of the synagogue of Worms to the
          Sanhedrim. Had it been written in the eleventh century, it would
          not have represented the Pope as the refuge of the persecuted Jews,
          for it was the Emperor who redressed their wrongs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was in
          the thirteenth century that the Popes stood forth as the special
          protectors of the Jews. On May 1, 1291, the Jewish bankers
          throughout France were seized and imprisoned by order of Philip the
          Fair, and forced to pay enormous mulcts. Some died under torture,
          most yielded, and then fled the inhospitable realm. Five years
          after, in one day, all the Jews in France were taken, their
          property confiscated to the Crown, the race expelled the realm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1320, the
          Jews of the South of France, notwithstanding persecution and
          expulsion, were again in numbers and perilous prosperity. On them
          burst the fury of the Pastoureaux. Five hundred took refuge in the
          royal castle of Verdun on the Garonne. The royal officers refused
          to defend them. The shepherds set fire to the lower stories of a
          lofty tower; the Jews slew each other, having thrown their children
          to the mercy of their assailants. Everywhere, even in the great
          cities, Auch, Toulouse, Castel Sarrazen, the Jews were left to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name=
          "Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be remorselessly
          massacred and their property pillaged. The Pope himself might have
          seen the smoke of the fires that consumed them darkening the
          horizon from the walls of Avignon. But John XXII., cold, arrogant,
          rapacious, stood by unmoved. He launched his excommunication, not
          against the murderers of the inoffensive Jews, but against all who
          presumed to take the Cross without warrant of the Holy See. Even
          that same year he published violent bulls against the poor
          persecuted Hebrews, and commanded the Bishops to destroy their
          Talmud, the source of their detestable blasphemies; but he bade
          those who should submit to baptism to be protected from pillage and
          massacre.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Toledoth
          Jeschu, therefore, cannot have been written at the beginning of the
          fourteenth century, when the Jews had such experience of the
          indifference of a Pope to their wrongs. We are consequently forced
          to look to the thirteenth century as its date. And the thirteenth
          century will provide us with instances of persecution of the Jews
          in Germany, and Popes exerting themselves to protect them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1236, the
          Jews were the subject of an outburst of popular fury throughout
          Europe, but especially in Spain, where a fearful carnage took
          place. In France, the Crusaders of Guienne, Poitou, Anjou and
          Brittany killed them, without sparing the women and children. Women
          with child were ripped up. The unfortunate Jews were thrown down,
          and trodden under the feet of horses. Their houses were ransacked,
          their books burned, their treasures carried off. Those who refused
          baptism were tortured or killed. The unhappy people sent to Rome,
          and implored the Pope to extend his protection to them. Gregory IX.
          wrote at once to the Archbishop of Bordeaux, the Bishops of
          Saintes, Angoulême and Poictiers, forbidding constraint to be
          exercised on the Jews to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg
          099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          force them to receive baptism; and a letter to the King entreating
          him to exert his authority to repress the fury of the Crusaders
          against the Jews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1240, the
          Jews were expelled from Brittany by the Duke John, at the request
          of the Bishops of Brittany.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1246, the
          persecution reached its height in Germany. Bishops and nobles vied
          with each other in despoiling and harassing the unfortunate
          Hebrews. They were charged with killing Christian children and
          devouring their hearts at their Passover. Whenever a dead body was
          found, the Jews were accused of the murder. Hosts were dabbled in
          blood, and thrown down at their doors, and the ignorant mob rose
          against such profanation of the sacred mysteries. They were
          stripped of their goods, thrown into prison, starved, racked,
          condemned to the stake or to the gallows. From the German towns
          miserable trains of yellow-girdled and capped exiles issued,
          seeking some more hospitable homes. If they left behind them their
          wealth, they carried with them their industry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A deputation of
          German Rabbis visited the Pope, Innocent IV., at Lyons, and laid
          the complaints of the Jews before him. Innocent at once took up
          their cause. He wrote to all the bishops of Germany, on July 5th,
          1247, ordering them to favour the Jews, and insist on the redress
          of the wrongs to which they had been subjected, whether at the
          hands of ecclesiastics or nobles. A similar letter was then
          forwarded by him to all the bishops of France.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this period
          it was in vain for the Jews to appeal to the Emperor. Frederick II.
          was excommunicated, and Germany in revolt, fanned by the Pope,
          against him. A new Emperor had been proposed at a meeting at
          Budweis to the electors of Austria, Bohemia and Bavaria, but the
          proposition had been rejected. Henry of Thuringia, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> however, set up by Innocent, and
          supported by the ecclesiastical princes of Germany, had been
          crowned at Hochem. A crusade was preached against the Emperor
          Frederick; Henry of Thuringia was defeated and died. The
          indefatigable Innocent, clinging to the cherished policy of the
          Papal See to ruin the unity of Germany by stirring up intestine
          strife, found another candidate in William of Holland. He was
          crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle, October 3, 1247. From this time till
          his death, four years after, the cause of Frederick declined.
          Frederick was mostly engaged in wars in Italy, and had not leisure,
          if he had the power, to attend to and right the wrongs of his
          Jewish vassals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was at this
          period that I think we may conclude the Toledoth Jeschu of
          Wagenseil was written.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          consideration tends to confirm this view. The Wagenseil Toledoth
          Jeschu speaks of Elias rising up after the death of Simon Cephas,
          and denouncing him as having led the Christians away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was there any
          Elias at the close of the thirteenth century who did thus preach
          against the Pope? There was. Elias of Cortona, second General of
          the Franciscan Order, the leader of a strong reactionary party
          opposed to the Spirituals or Caesarians, those who maintained the
          rule in all its rigour, had been deposed, then carried back into
          the Generalship by a recoil of the party wave, then appealed
          against to the Pope, deposed once more, and finally excommunicated.
          Elias joined the Emperor Frederick, the deadly foe of Innocent IV.,
          and, sheltered under his wing, denounced the venality, the avarice,
          the extortion of the Papacy. As a close attendant on the German
          Emperor, his adviser, as one who encouraged him in his opposition
          to a Pope who protected the Jews, the German Jews must have heard
          of him. But the stone of excommunication firing at him struck him
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name=
          "Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> down, and he died in
          1253, making a death-bed reconciliation with Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though it is
          thus possible to give an historical explanation of the curious
          circumstance that the Toledoth Jeschu ranges the Pope among the
          friends of Judaism and the enemies of Christianity, and provide for
          the identification of Elias with the fallen General of the
          Minorites,—the story points perhaps to a dim recollection of Simon
          Peter being at the head of the Judaizing Church at Jerusalem and
          Rome, which made common cause with the Jews, and of Paul, here
          designated Elias, in opposition to him.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“In the reign of King Herod the Proselyte,
          there lived a man named Papus Ben Jehuda. To him was betrothed
          Mirjam, daughter of Kalphus; and her brother's name was Simeon. He
          was a Rabbi, the son of Kalphus. This Mirjam, before her betrothal,
          was a hair-dresser to women.... She was surpassing beautiful in
          form. She was of the tribe of Benjamin.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On account of
          her extraordinary beauty, she was kept locked up in a house; but
          she escaped through a window, and fled from Jerusalem to Bethlehem
          with Joseph Pandira, of Nazareth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been
          already said, Papus Ben Jehuda was a contemporary of Rabbi Akiba,
          and died about A.D. 140. In the Wagenseil Toledoth Jeschu, Mirjam
          is betrothed to a Jochanan. In the latter, Mary lives at Bethlehem;
          in the Toledoth of Huldrich, she resides at Jerusalem.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many years
          after, the place of the retreat of Mirjam and Joseph Pandira having
          been made known to Herod, he sent to Bethlehem orders for their
          arrest, and for the massacre of the children; but Joseph, who had
          been forewarned by a kinsman in the court of Herod, fled in time
          with his wife and children into Egypt.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

            Fish-valley. And Jeschu was very grieved, and in his anger he
            plucked the hat from off his head, and cast it on the ground and
            burst into lamentations. Thereupon the boys warned him to put his
            hat on again, for it was not comely to be with uncovered head.
            Jeschu answered, Verily, Moses gave you not this law; it is but

          journey, and various adventures befal them, and the Lord orders
          things very differently from what Peter expects. To this follows
          another story, familiar to English school-boys. The apostles come
          with their Master to an inn, and ask for food. The innkeeper has a
          goose, and it is decided that he shall have the goose who dreams
          the best dream that night. When all are asleep, Judas gets up,
          plucks, roasts and eats the goose. Next morning they tell their
          dreams. Judas says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mine was the best of
          all, for I dreamt that in the night I ate the goose; and, lo! the
          goose is gone this morning. I think the dream must have been a
          reality.”</span> Among English school-boys, the story is told of an
          Englishman, and Scotchman, and an Irishman. The latter, of course,
          takes the place of Judas.</p>

            Gospels, which alone are received without dispute by the Church
            of God under heaven, that the first was written by St. Matthew,
            once a tax-gatherer, afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ, who
            published it for the benefit of the Jewish converts, composed in

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eusebius, who
            had collected the foregoing testimonies on a subject which, in
            that day, seems to have been undisputed, thus records what he

            delivered to them, when he was preparing to depart to other

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome
            follows Papias: <span class="tei tei-q">“Matthew, who is also
            Levi, from a publican became an apostle, and he first composed
            his Gospel of Christ in Judaea, for those of the circumcision who
            believed, and wrote it in Hebrew words and characters; but who
            translated it afterwards into Greek is not very evident. Now this
            Hebrew Gospel is preserved to this day in the library at Caesarea

            important Greek codices of St. Matthew close with the statement
            that he wrote in Hebrew; the Syriac and Arabic versions do the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
            that this Hebrew Gospel of the Twelve was the only one with which
            Justin Martyr was acquainted.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin Martyr
            was a native of Samaria, and his acquaintance with Christianity
            was probably made in the communities of Nazarenes scattered over
            Syria. By family he was a Greek, and was therefore by blood
            inclined to sympathize with the Gentile rather than the Jewish
            Christians. This double tendency is manifest in his writings. He
            judges the Ebionites, even the narrowest of their sectarian
            rings, with great tenderness; but he proclaims that Gentiledom
            had yielded better Christians than Jewdom.<a id="noteref_155"
            name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>
            Justin distinguishes between the Ebionites. There were those who
            in their own practice observed the Mosaic Law, believing in
            Christ as the flower and end of the Law, but without exacting the
            same observance of believing Gentiles; and there were those, who
            not only observed the Law themselves, but imposed it on their
            Gentile converts. His sympathies were with the former, whom he
            regards as the true followers of the apostles, and not with the
            latter.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin's
            conversion took place circ. A.D. 133. He is a valuable testimony
            to the divisions among the Nazarenes or Ebionites in the second
            century, just when Gnostic views were infiltrating among the
            extreme Judaizing section.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin
            Martyr's Christian training took place in the Nazarene Church, in
            the orthodox, milder section. He no doubt inherited the
            traditional prejudice against St. Paul, for he neither mentions
            him by name, nor quotes any of his writings. That he should have
            omitted to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
            124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            quote St. Paul in his Dialogue with Trypho the Jew is not
            surprising; but one cannot doubt that had he seen the Epistles of
            the Apostle of the Gentiles, he would have cited them, or shown
            that they had influenced the current of his thoughts in his two
            Apologies addressed to Gentiles. He quotes <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the book that is called the Gospel”</span> as if
            there were but one; but what Gospel was it? It has been
            frequently observed that the quotations of Justin are closer to
            the parallel passages in St. Matthew than to those of the other
            Canonical Gospels. But the only Gospel he names is the Gospel of
            the Twelve.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Did Justin
            Martyr possess the Gospel of St. Matthew, or some other?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            observable that he diverges from the Gospel narrative in several
            particulars. It is inconceivable that this was caused by defect
            of memory. Two or three of those texts in which he differs from
            our Canonical Gospels occur several times in his writings, and
            always in the same form.<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156"
            href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>
            Would it not be strange that his memory should fail him each
            time, and on each of these passages? But though his memory may
            have been inaccurate in recording exact words, the differences
            that have been noticed between the citations of Justin Martyr and
            the Canonical Gospel of St. Matthew are not confined to words;
            they extend to particulars, to facts. Verbal differences are
            accountable for by lapse of memory, but it is not so with facts.
            One can understand how in quoting by memory the mode of
            expressing the same facts may vary, but not that the facts
            themselves should be different. If the facts cited are different,
            we are forced to conclude that the citations were derived from
            another source. And such is the case with Justin.</p><span class=

            near Bethlehem; that, when he was baptized, a bright light shone
            over him; and he gives words which were heard from heaven, which
            are not recorded by any of the Evangelists.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That our Lord
            was born in a cave is probable enough, but where did Justin learn
            it? Certainly not from St. Matthew's Gospel, which gives no
            particulars of the birth of Christ at Bethlehem. St. Luke says he
            was born in the stable of an inn. Justin, we are warranted in
            suspecting, derived the fact of the stable being a cave from the
            only Gospel with which he was acquainted, that of the
            Hebrews.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tradition
            of the scene of Christ's nativity having been a cave was
            peculiarly Jewish. It is found in the Apocryphal Gospels of the
            Nativity and the Protevangelium, both of which unquestionably
            grew up in Judaea. That Justin should endorse this tradition
            leads to the conclusion that he found it so stated in his
            Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shall speak
            of the light and voice at the baptism presently.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Epiphanius
            says that the Ebionite Gospel began with, <span class=

            high-priest, there was a man whose name was John,”</span> and so
            on, like the 3rd chap. St. Matthew. But this was the mutilated
            Gospel of the Hebrews used by the Gnostic Ebionites, who were
            heretical on the doctrine of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            Martyr speaks of as rejecting the supernatural birth of
            Christ.<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
            Nazarenes, orthodox and heretical, but one Gospel was recognized,
            and that the Hebrew Gospel of the Twelve; but the Gospel in use
            among the Gnostic Ebionites became more and more corrupt as they
            diverged further from orthodoxy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was this
            Gospel of the Twelve, or of the Hebrews, the original of St.
            Matthew's Canonical Greek Gospel, or was it a separate
            compilation? This is a question to be considered presently.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The statement
            of the Fathers that the Gospel of St. Matthew was first written
            in Hebrew, must of course be understood to mean that it was
            written in Aramaic or Palestinian Syriac.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now we have
            extant two versions of the Gospels, St. Matthew's included, in
            Syriac, the Peschito and the Philoxenian. The latter needs only a
            passing mention; it was avowedly made from the Greek, A.D. 508.
            But the Peschito is much more ancient. The title of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Peschito”</span> is an emphatic Syrian term for that
            which is <span class="tei tei-q">“simple,”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“uncorrupt”</span> and <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“true;”</span> and, applied from the beginning to
            this version, it strongly indicates the veneration and confidence
            with which it has ever been regarded by all the Churches of the
            East.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href=
            "#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            When this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
            127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            version was made cannot be decided by scholars. A copy in the
            Laurentian Library bears so early a date as A.D. 586; but it
            existed long before the translation was made by Philoxenus in
            508. The first Armenian version from the Greek was made in 431,
            and the Armenians already, at that date, had a version from the
            Syriac, made by Isaac, Patriarch of Armenia, some twenty years
            previously, in 410. Still further back, we find the Peschito
            version quoted in the writings of St. Ephraem, who lived not
            later than A.D. 370.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href=
            "#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was this
            Peschito version founded on the Greek canonical text, or, in the
            case of St. Matthew, on the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Hebrew”</span> Gospel? I think there can be little
            question that it was translated from the Greek. There can be no
            question that the Gospels of St. Mark, St. Luke, St. John, the
            Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles of St. Paul, and those of the
            other Epistles contained in this version,<a id="noteref_166"
            name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a> are
            from the Greek, and it is probable that the version of St.
            Matthew was made at the same time from the received text. The
            Syrian churches were separated from the Nazarene community in
            sympathy; their acceptance of St. Paul's Epistles is a proof that
            they were so; and these Epistles were accepted by them at a very
            early age, as we gather from internal evidence in the
            translation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Syrian
            churches would be likely, moreover, when seeking for copies of
            the Christian Scriptures, to ask for them from churches which
            were regarded as orthodox, rather than from a dwindling community
            which was thought to be heretical.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Peschito
            version of St. Matthew follows the canonical Greek text, and not
            the Gospel of the Hebrews, in such passages as can be
            compared;<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href=

            one of the peculiarities of the latter find their echo in the
            Peschito text.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
            the Hebrews has not, therefore, been preserved to us in the
            Peschito St. Matthew. The translations made by St. Jerome in
            Greek and Latin have also perished. It is not difficult to
            account for the loss of the book. The work itself was in use only
            by converted Jews; it was in the exclusive possession of the
            descendants of those parties for whose use it had been written.
            The Greek Gospels, on the other hand, spread as Christianity
            grew. The Nazarenes themselves passed away, and their cherished
            Gospel soon ceased to be known among men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some exemplars
            may have been preserved for a time in public libraries, but these
            would not survive the devastation to which the country was
            exposed from the Saracens and other invaders, and it is not
            probable that a solitary copy survives.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if the
            entire Gospel of the Hebrews has not been preserved to us, we
            have got sufficiently numerous fragments, cited by ancient
            ecclesiastical writers, to permit us, to a certain extent, to
            judge of the tendencies and character of that Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            necessary to observe, as preliminary to our quotations, that the
            early Fathers cited passages from this Gospel without the
            smallest prejudice against it either historically or doctrinally.
            They do not seem to have considered it apocryphal, as open to
            suspicion, either <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
            129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            because it contained doctrine at variance with the Canonical
            Greek Gospels, or because it narrated circumstances not found in
            them. On the contrary, they refer to it as a good, trustworthy
            authority for the facts of our Lord's life, and for the doctrines
            he taught.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Ignatius,

            inserted in it a passage relative to the appearance of our Lord
            to his apostles after his resurrection, not found in the
            Canonical Gospels, and we should not know whence he had drawn it,

            Origen, who makes some quotations from this Gospel, does not, it
            is true, range it with the Canonical Gospels, but he speaks of it
            with great respect, as one highly esteemed by many Christians of
            his time.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the fourth
            century, no agreement had been come to as to the value of this
            Gospel. Eusebius tells us that by some it was reckoned among the

            the Canonical and the Apocryphal Gospels.<a id="noteref_172"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
            St. Matthew and the Gospel of the Hebrews were not identical. It
            is impossible to doubt this when we examine the passages of the
            latter quoted by ecclesiastical writers, the majority of which
            are not to be found in the former, and the rest differ from the
            Canonical Gospel, either in details or in the construction of the
            passages which correspond.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Did the
            difference extend further? This is a question <span class=

            "Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it is impossible to answer
            positively in one way or the other, since we only know those
            passages of the Gospel of the Nazarenes which have been quoted by
            the early Fathers.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is
            probable that the two Gospels did not differ from each other
            except in these passages; for if the divergence was greater, one
            cannot understand how St. Jerome, who had both under his eyes,
            could have supposed one to have been the Hebrew original of the
            other. And if both resembled each other closely, it is easy to
            suppose that the ecclesiastical writers who quoted from the
            Nazarene Gospel, quoted only those passages which were peculiar
            to it.</p>

            Origen and Jerome take pains to give this passage an orthodox and
            unexceptionable meaning. Instead of rejecting the passage as
            apocryphal, they labour to explain it away—a proof of the high
            estimation in which the Gospel of the Twelve was held. The

            words, <span class="tei tei-q">“by one of my hairs;”</span> for
            on one of the occasions on which Origen quotes the passage, these
            words are omitted. Probably they did not exist in all the copies

            Elkesaites were certainly one with the Ebionites in their
            hostility to St. Paul, whose Epistles, as Origen tells us, they
            rejected.<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href=

            that they were a Jewish sect which had relations with Ebionitism
            appears from a story told by St. Epiphanius, that their supposed
            founder, Elxai, went over to the Ebionites in the time of
            Trajan.<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href=
            "#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            They issued from the same fruitful field of converts, the
            Essenes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The term by
            which the Holy Spirit is designated in Hebrew is feminine, and
            lent itself to a theory of the Holy Spirit being a female
            principle, and this rapidly slid into identification of the
            Spirit with Mary.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            Clementines insist on the universe being compounded of the male
            and the female elements. There are two sorts of prophecy, the
            male which speaks of the world to come, the female which deals
            with the world that is; the female principle rules this world,
            the body, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg
            132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            all that is visible and material. Beside this female principle
            stands Christ, the male principle, ruling the spirits of men, and
            all that is invisible and immaterial.<a id="noteref_181" name=
            "noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a> The
            Holy Spirit, brooding over the deep and calling the world into
            being, became therefore the female principle in the Elkesaite
            Trinity.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Gnosticism,
            this deification of the female principle, which was represented
            as Prounikos or Sophia among the Valentinians, led to the
            incarnation of the principle in women who accompanied the
            heresiarchs Simon and Apelles. Thus the Eternal Wisdom was
            incarnate in Helena, who accompanied Dositheus and afterwards
            Simon Magus,<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href=
            "#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> and
            in the fair Philoumena who associated with Apelles.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
            influence seems imperceptibly to have been at work in the Church
            of the Middle Ages, and in the pictures and sculptures of the
            coronation of the Virgin. Mary seems in Catholic art to have
            assumed a position as one of the Trinity.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            original Gospel of the Hebrews, the passage probably stood thus:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And straightway the Holy Spirit took me,
            and bore me to the great mountain Thabor;”</span> and Origen and
            Jerome quoted from a text corrupted by the Gnostic Ebionites. The
            words <span class="tei tei-q">“bore me by one of my hairs”</span>
            were added to assimilate the translation to that of Habbacuc by
            the angel, in the apocryphal addition to the Book of Daniel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We next come
            to a passage found in the Stromata of Clement of Alexandria, who
            compares it with a sentence <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> from the Theaetetus of Plato: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">He who wondereth shall reign, and he who
            reigneth shall rest.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_183"
            name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, like the
            preceding quotation, has a Gnostic hue; but it is impossible to
            determine its sense in the absence of the context. Nor does the
            passage in the Theaetetus throw any light upon it. The whole of
            the passage in St. Clement is this: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            beginning of (or search after) truth is admiration,”</span> says
            Plato. <span class="tei tei-q">“And Matthias, in saying to us in
            his Traditions, Wonder at what is before you, proves that
            admiration is the first step leading upwards to knowledge.
            Therefore also it is written in the Gospel of the Hebrews, He who
            shall wonder shall reign, and he who reigns shall
            rest.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What were
            these Traditions of Matthias? In another place St. Clement of
            Alexandria mentions them, and quotes a passage from them, an
            instruction of St. Matthias: <span class="tei tei-q">“If he who
            is neighbour to one of the elect sins, the elect sins with him;
            for if he (the elect) had conducted himself as the Word requires,
            then his neighbour would have looked to his ways, and not have
            sinned.”</span><a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href=
            "#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a>
            And, again, he says that the followers of Carpocrates appealed to
            the authority of St. Matthias—probably, therefore, to this book,
            his Traditions—as an excuse for giving rein to their lusts.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            Traditions of St. Matthias evidently contained another version of
            the same passage, or perhaps a portion of the same discourse
            attributed to our Lord, which ran somehow thus: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Wonder at, what is before your
            eyes</span></span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
            134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the mighty works that I
            do); <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">for he that wondereth shall reign, and he
            that reigneth shall rest</span></span>.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
            impossible that this may be a genuine reminiscence of part of our
            Lord's teaching.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin Martyr,
            in his Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, says that Jesus exercised
            the trade of a carpenter, and that he made carts, yokes, and like
            articles.<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where did he
            learn this? Not from St. Matthew's Gospel; probably from the lost
            Gospel which he quotes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome
            quotes as a saying of our Lord, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Be ye proved

            has no hesitation in calling it a saying of the Saviour. It

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a> It
            is cited much more fully by St. Clement of Alexandria in his
            Stromata: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Be ye proved
            money-changers; retain that which is good metal, reject that
            which is bad.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_189" name=

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a>
            Neither St. Jerome, St. Clement of Alexandria, nor the author of
            the Clementines, give their authority for the statement they
            make, that this is a saying of the Lord; but we may, I think,
            fairly conclude that St. Jerome drew it from the Hebrew Gospel he
            knew so well, having translated it into Greek and Latin, and
            which he looked upon as an unexceptionable authority.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whence the
            passage came may be guessed by the use made of it by those who
            quote it. It probably followed our Lord's saying, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I am not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil
            it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless, be ye proved
            exchangers; retain that which is good metal, reject that which is
            bad.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
            135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            passage is not given to us verbatim by St. Jerome; he merely
            alludes to it in one of his Commentaries, saying that Jesus had
            declared him guilty of a grievous crime who saddened the spirit
            of his brother.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href=
            "#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> It
            probably occurred in the portion of the Gospel of the Hebrews
            corresponding with the 18th chapter of St. Matthew, and may be
            restored somewhat as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe unto
            the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences
            come; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">but woe to that man by whom the offence
            cometh, and the soul of his brother be made sore</span></span>.
            Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee,”</span>
            &amp;c.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            passage is in perfect harmony with the teaching of our Lord, and,
            like that given last, may very possibly have formed part of his
            teaching. It is also given by St. Jerome, and therefore in Latin:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Be never glad unless ye are in charity with

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome, in
            his treatise against Pelagius, quotes from the Gospel of the

            Lord answered, saying, Verily I say unto thee, until seventy
            times seven</span></span>;”</span> and then probably,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            when the same story was in the well-known Canonical Greek Gospel
            of St. John? The conclusion one must arrive at is, either that
            the stories were sufficiently <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> differently related for him not to
            recognize them as the same, or that the incident in St. John's
            Gospel is an excerpt from the Gospel of the Hebrews, or rather
            from a translation of it, grafted into the text of the Canonical
            Gospel. The latter opinion is favoured by some critics, who think
            that the story of the woman taken in adultery did not belong to
            the original text, but was inserted in it in the fourth or fifth
            century.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those passages
            of the Gospel of the Nazarenes which most resemble passages in
            the Gospel of St. Matthew are not, however, identical with them;
            some differ only in the wording, but others by the form in which
            they are given.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the
            remarkable peculiarity about them is, that the lessons in the
            Gospel of the Hebrews seem preferable to those in the Canonical
            Gospel. This was apparently the opinion of St. Jerome.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In chap. vi.
            ver. 11 of St. Matthew's Gospel, we have the article of the
            Lord's Prayer, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us this day our
            daily bread.”</span> The words used in the Greek of St. Matthew
            are, τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον. The word ἐπιούσιος is one met
            with nowhere else, and is peculiar. The word οὐσία means
            originally that which is essential, and belongs to the true
            nature or property of things. In Stoic philosophy it had the same
            significance as ὕλη, matter; ἐπιούσιον ἄρτον would therefore seem
            most justly to be rendered by <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">supersubstantial</span></em>, the word
            employed by St. Jerome.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Give us this day our supernatural bread.”</span> But
            in the Gospel of the Nazarenes, according to St. Jerome, the
            Syro-Chaldaic word for ἐπιούσιον was מחד, which signifies
            <span class="tei tei-q">“to-morrow's,”</span> that is, our
            <span class="tei tei-q">“future,”</span> or <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“daily”</span> bread. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Give us this day the bread for the
            morrow</span></span>,”</span><a id="noteref_201" name=
            "noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a>
            certainly was synonymous with, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us
            this day our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg
            138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            daily bread.”</span> It is curious that the Protestant Reformers,
            shrinking from translating the word ἐπιούσιον according to its
            apparently legitimate rendering, lest they should give colour to
            the Catholic idea of the daily bread of the Christian soul being
            the Eucharist, should have adopted a rendering more in accordance
            with an Apocryphal than with a Canonical Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In St.
            Matthew, xxiii. 35, Jesus reproaches the Jews for their treatment
            of the prophets, and declares them responsible for all the blood
            shed upon the earth, <span class="tei tei-q">“from the blood of
            righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias,
            whom ye slew between the Temple and the altar.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the
            Zacharias to whom our Lord referred was Zechariah, son of
            Jehoiada, and not of Barachias, who was stoned <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“in the court of the house of the Lord”</span> by
            order of Joash.<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href=
            "#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>
            Zacharias, son of Barachias, was not killed till long after the
            death of our Lord. He was massacred by the zealots inside the
            Temple, shortly before the siege, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            about A.D. 69.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Either, then,
            the Greek Gospel of St. Matthew was not written till after the
            siege of Jerusalem, and so this anachronism passed into it, or
            the error is due to a copyist, who, having heard of the murder of
            Zacharias, son of Barachias, but who knew nothing of the
            Zacharias mentioned in Chronicles, corrected the Jehoiada of the
            original into Barachias, thinking that thereby he was rectifying
            a mistake.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in the
            Gospel of the Nazarenes the name stood correctly, and the passage
            read, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">from the blood of
            righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, the son of
            Jehoiada</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_203" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In both these
            last quoted passages, the preference is to be given to the
            Nazarene Gospel, and probably also in that relating to
            forgiveness of a brother. The lost Gospel in that passage
            requires the brother to make satisfaction. It is no doubt the
            higher course to forgive a brother, whether he repent or not,
            seventy times seven times in the day; but it may almost certainly
            be concluded that our Lord meant that the forgiveness should be
            conditional on his repentance, for in St. Luke's Gospel the
            repentance of the trespassing brother is distinctly required.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If thy brother trespass against thee,
            rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass
            against thee seven times a day, and seven times in a day turn
            again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive
            him.”</span><a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> In
            St. Luke this is addressed to all the disciples; in St. Matthew,
            to Peter alone; but there can be little doubt that both passages
            refer to the same instruction, and that the fuller accounts in
            St. Luke and the Gospel of the Hebrews are the more correct.
            There may be less elevation in the precept, subject to the two
            restrictions, first, that the offence should be a verbal one, and
            secondly, that it should be apologized for; but it brings it more
            within compass of being practised.</p>

                  unto him, Why callest thous me good? there is none good but
                  one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep
                  the commandments. He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said,

                  young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The comparison
            of these two accounts is not favourable to that in the Canonical
            Gospel. It is difficult to understand how a Jew could have asked,
            as did the rich young man, what commandments he ought to keep in
            order that he might enter into life. The Decalogue was known by
            heart by every Jew. Moreover, the narrative in the lost Gospel is
            more connected than in the Canonical Gospel. The reproach made by
            our Lord is admirably calculated to bring home to the rich man's
            conscience the truth, that, though professing to observe the
            letter of the Law, he was far from practising its spirit; and
            this leads up quite naturally to the declaration of the
            difficulty of a rich man obtaining salvation, or rather to our
            Lord's repeating a proverb probably common at the time in the
            East.<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And lastly, in
            the proverb addressed aside to Peter, instead of to the rich
            young man, that air of harshness which our Lord's words bear in
            the Canonical Gospel, as spoken to the young man in his sorrow,
            entirely disappears. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg

            retired.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
            Gospel stood as in this latter passage quoted in the second
            century among the orthodox Christians of Palestine is probable,
            because with it agrees the brief citation of Justin Martyr, who
            says that when our Lord was baptized, there shone a great light
            around, and a voice was heard from heaven, saying, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
            thee.”</span> Both occur in the Ebionite Gospel; neither in the
            Canonical Gospel.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Gospel
            was certainly known to the writer of the Canonical Epistle to the
            Hebrews, for he twice takes this statement as authoritative.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For unto which of the angels said he at
            any time, Thou art my Son, this day, have I begotten
            thee?”</span> and more remarkably, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Christ glorified not himself to be made an
            high-priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to-day
            have I begotten thee.”</span><a id="noteref_213" name=
            "noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> In
            the latter passage the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
            145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            author is speaking of the calling of priests being miraculous and
            manifest; and then he cites this call of Christ to the priesthood
            as answering these requirements.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The order of
            events is not the same in the Gospel of Twelve and in that of St.
            Matthew: verses 14 and 15 of the latter, modified in an important
            point, come in the Ebionite Gospel after verses 16 and 17.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
            serious discrepancy between the account of the baptism of our
            Lord in St. Matthew and in St. John. In the former Canonical
            Gospel, the Baptist forbids Christ to be baptized by him, saying,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I have need to be baptized of thee, and
            comest thou to me?”</span> But Jesus bids him: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to
            fulfil all righteousness.”</span> Then Jesus is baptized, and the
            heavens are opened. But in St. John's Gospel, the Baptist says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I knew him not: but he that sent me to
            baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt
            see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, the same is he
            which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bare record,
            that this is the Son of God.”</span><a id="noteref_214" name=
            "noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the
            account in the Gospel of the Twelve removes this discrepancy.
            John does not know Jesus till after the light and the descent of
            the dove and the voice, and then he asks to be baptized by
            Jesus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is apparent
            that the passage in the lost Gospel is more correct than that in
            the Canonical one. In the latter there has been an inversion of
            verses destroying the succession of events, and thus producing
            discrepancy with the account in St. John's Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these
            passages from the Gospel of the Twelve may be compared a curious
            one from the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs. It occurs in the
            Testament of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg
            146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Levi, and is a prophecy of the Messiah. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The heavens shall open for thee, and from above the
            temple of glory the voice of the Father shall dispense
            sanctification upon him, as has been promised unto Abraham, the
            father of Isaac.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage
            quoted by St. Epiphanius is wholly unobjectionable doctrinally.
            It is not so with that quoted by St. Jerome; it is of a very
            different character. It exhibits strongly the Gnostic ideas which
            infected the stricter sect of the Ebionites.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
            precisely on the baptism of the Lord that they laid the greatest
            stress; and it is in the account of that event that we should
            expect to find the greatest divergence between the texts employed
            by the orthodox and the heretical Nazarenes. Before his baptism
            he was nothing. It was then only that the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“full fount of the Holy Ghost”</span> descended on
            him, his election to the Messiahship was revealed, and divine
            power was communicated to him to execute the mission entrusted to
            him. A marked distinction was drawn between two portions in the
            life of Jesus—before and after his baptism. In the first they
            acknowledged nothing but the mere human nature, to the entire
            exclusion of everything supernatural; while the sudden accruing
            of supernatural aid at the baptism marked the moment when he
            became the Messiah. Thus the baptism was the beginning of their
            Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before that,
            he is liable to sin, he suggests that his believing himself to be
            free from sin may have precipitated him into sin, the sin of
            ignorance. And <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">even in the
            prophets, after they had received the unction of the Holy Ghost,
            there was found sinful speech</span></span>.”</span><a id=
            "noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>
            This quotation follows, in St. Jerome, immediately after the
            saying <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg
            147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            cited above enjoining forgiveness, but it in no way dovetails
            into it; the passage concerning the recommendation by St. Mary
            and the brethren that they should go up to be baptized of John
            for the remission of sins, comes in the same chapter, and there
            can be little doubt that this reference to the prophets as sinful
            formed part of the answer of the Virgin to Jesus when he spoke of
            his being sinless.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome
            obtained his copy of the Gospel of the Hebrews from Beraea in
            Syria, and not therefore from the purest source. Had he copied
            and translated the codex he found in the library of Pamphilus at
            Caesarea, instead of that he procured from Beraea, it is probable
            that he would have found it not to contain the passages of
            Gnostic tendency.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            interpolations were made in the second century, when Gnostic
            ideas had begun to affect the Ebionites, and break them up into
            more or less heretical sects.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their copies
            of the Gospel of the Hebrews differed, for the Gnostic Ebionites
            curtailed it in some places, and amplified it in others.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In
            reconstructing the primitive lost Gospel of the Nazarenes, it is
            very necessary to note these Gnostic passages, and to withdraw
            them from the text. We shall come to some more of their additions
            and alterations presently. It is sufficient for us to note here
            that the heretical Gospel in use among the Gnostic Ebionites was
            based on the orthodox Gospel of the Hebrews. The existence of
            these two versions explains the very different treatment their
            Gospel meets with at the hands of the Fathers of the Church.
            Some, and these the earliest, speak of this Gospel with
            reverence, and place it almost on a line with the Canonical
            Gospels; others speak of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> it with horror, as an heretical corruption
            of the Gospel of St. Matthew. The former saw the primitive text,
            the latter the curtailed and amplified version in use among the
            heretical Ebionites.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Paul, in
            his first Epistle to the Corinthians, alludes to one of the
            appearances of our Lord after his resurrection, of which no
            mention is made in the Canonical Gospels: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“After that, he was seen of James.”</span><a id=
            "noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> But
            according to his account, this appearance took place after
            several other manifestations, viz. after that to Cephas, that to
            the Twelve, and that to five hundred brethren at once. But it
            preceded another appearance to <span class="tei tei-q">“all the
            apostles.”</span> If we take the first and second to have
            occurred on Easter-day, and the last to have been the appearance
            to them again <span class="tei tei-q">“after eight days,”</span>
            when St. Thomas was present, then the appearance to St. James
            must have taken place between the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“even”</span> of Easter-day and Low Sunday.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the Gospel
            of the Hebrews gives a particular account of this visit to James,
            which however, according to this account, took place early on
            Easter-day, certainly before Christ stood in the midst of the
            apostles in the upper room on Easter-evening.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome
            says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Gospel according to the
            Hebrews relates that after the resurrection of the Saviour,
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Lord, after he had given the napkin to

            Now James had sworn with an oath that he would not eat bread from
            that hour when he drank the cup of the Lord, till he should
            behold him rising from amidst them that
            sleep.</span></span>’</span> And again, a little after,
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Lord said, Bring a table and

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This touching
            incident is quite in keeping with what we know about St. James,
            the Lord's brother.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James the
            Just, according to Hegesippus, <span class="tei tei-q">“neither
            drank wine nor fermented liquors, and abstained from animal
            food;”</span><a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a> and
            though the account of Hegesippus is manifestly fabulous in some
            of its details, still there is no reason to doubt that James
            belonged to the ascetic school among the Jews, as did the Baptist
            before him, and as did the orthodox Ebionites after him. The oath
            to abstain from food till a certain event was accomplished was
            not unusual.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is meant
            by <span class="tei tei-q">“the Saviour giving the napkin to the
            servant of the priest,”</span> it is impossible to conjecture
            without the context. The napkin was probably that which had
            covered his face in the tomb, but whether the context linked this
            on to the cycle of sacred sindones impressed with the portrait of
            the Saviour's suffering face, cannot be told. The designation of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Just”</span> as applied to James is
            for the purpose of distinguishing him from James the brother of
            John. He does not bear that name in the Canonical Gospels, but
            the title may have been introduced by St. Jerome to avoid
            confusion, or it may have been a marginal gloss to the text.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The story of
            this appearance found its way into the <span class="tei tei-pb"

            no doubt drew it from St. Jerome; and thence it passed into the
            Legenda Aurea of Jacques de Voragine.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the Lord
            did appear to St. James on Easter-day, as related in this lost
            Gospel, then it may have been in the morning, and not after his
            appearance to the Twelve, or on his appearance in the evening he
            may have singled out and addressed James before all the others,
            as on that day week he addressed St. Thomas. In either case, St.
            Paul's version would be inaccurate as to the order of
            manifestations. The pseudo-Abdias, not in any way trustworthy,
            thus relates the circumstance:</p>

            arisen from the dead; for he remembered that when Christ was
            alive he had given this precept to him and to his brethren. That
            is why he, with Mary Magdalene and Peter, was the first of all to
            whom Jesus Christ appeared, in order to confirm his disciples in
            the faith; and that he might not suffer him to fast any longer, a

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Ignatius,
            who cites these words, excepting only those within brackets, does
            not say whence he drew them; but St. Jerome informs us that they
            were taken from the Gospel of the Hebrews. At the same time he
            gives the passage with greater fulness than St. Ignatius.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The account in
            St. Matthew contains nothing at all like this; but St. Luke
            mentions these circumstances, though with considerable
            differences. The Lord having appeared in the midst of his
            disciples, they imagine that they see a spirit. Then he says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
            arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The narrative
            in St. Luke's Gospel is fuller than that in the Gospel of the
            Hebrews, and is not derived from it. In the Nazarene Gospel, as
            soon as the apostles see and touch, they believe. But in the
            Canonical Gospel of St. Luke, they are not convinced till they
            see Christ eat.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin Martyr
            cites a passage now found in the Canonical Gospel of St. John,
            but not exactly as there, evidently therefore obtaining it from
            an independent source, and that source was the Gospel of the
            Twelve, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg
            152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the only one with which he was acquainted, the only one then
            acknowledged as Canonical in the Nazarene Church.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage
            is, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ has said,
            Except ye be regenerate, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In St. John's
            Gospel the parallel passage is couched in the third person:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Except a man be born again, he cannot
            see the kingdom of God.”</span><a id="noteref_225" name=

            difference stands out more clearly in the Greek than in
            English.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may
            conjecture that the primitive Gospel of the Hebrews contained an
            account of the interview of Nicodemus with our Lord. When we come
            to consider the Gospel used by the author of the Clementine
            Homilies and Recognitions, we shall find that the instruction on
            new birth made to Nicodemus was familiar to him, but not exactly
            in the form in which it is recorded by St. John.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome
            informs us that the lost Gospel we are considering did not relate
            that the veil of the Temple was rent in twain when Jesus gave up
            the ghost, but that the lintel stone, a huge stone, fell
            down.<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this
            tradition may be true is not unlikely. The rocks were rent, and
            the earth quaked, and it is probable enough that the Temple was
            so shaken that the great lintel stone fell.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Epiphanius
            gives us another fragment:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            Clementine Recognitions, a work issuing from the Ebionite
            anti-Gnostic school, we find that the abolition of the sacrifices
            was strongly insisted on. The abomination of idolatry is first
            exposed, and the strong hold that Egyptian idolatry had upon the
            Israelites is pointed out; then we are told Moses received the
            Law, and, in consideration of the prejudices of the people,
            tolerated sacrifice:</p>

            <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

            "font-size: 90%">When Moses perceived that the vice of
            sacrificing to idols had been deeply ingrained into the people
            from their association with the Egyptians, and that the root of
            this evil could not be extracted from them, he allowed them to
            sacrifice indeed, but permitted it to be done only to God, that
            by any means he might cut off one half of the deeply ingrained
            evil, leaving the other half to be corrected by another, and at a
            future time; by him, namely, concerning whom he said himself, A
            prophet shall the Lord your God raise unto you, whom ye shall
            hear, even as myself, according to all things which he shall say
            to you. Whosoever shall not hear that prophet, his soul shall be
            cut off from his people.</span><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This hostility
            to the Jewish sacrificial system by Ebionites who observed all
            the other Mosaic institutions was due to their having sprung out
            of the old sect of the Essenes, who held the sacrifices in the
            same abhorrence.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That our Lord
            may have spoken against the sacrifices is possible enough. The
            passage may have stood thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Think not
            that I am come to destroy the Law and the Prophets; I am not come
            to destroy, but to fulfil; nevertheless, I tell you the truth, I
            am come to destroy the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
            154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            sacrifices. But be ye approved money-changers, choose that which
            is good metal, reject that which is bad.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
            that in the original Hebrew Gospel there was some such passage,
            for St. Paul, or whoever was the author of the Epistle to the
            Hebrews, apparently alludes to it twice. He says, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“When he cometh into the world he saith, Sacrifice
            and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared
            me.”</span><a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> The
            plain meaning of which is, not that David had used those words
            centuries before, in prophecy, but that Jesus had used them
            himself when he came into the world. If the writer of the Epistle
            did quote a passage from the Hebrew Gospel, it will have been the
            second from the same source.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            Ebionite Gospel, <span class="tei tei-q">“by a criminal
            fraud,”</span> says St. Epiphanius, a protestation has been
            placed in the mouth of the Lord against the Paschal Sacrifice of
            the Lamb, by changing a positive phrase into a negative one.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            disciples ask Jesus where they shall prepare the Passover, he is
            made to reply, not, as in St. Luke, that with desire he had
            desired to eat this Passover, but, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Have I then any desire to eat the flesh of
            the Paschal Lamb with you?</span></span>”</span><a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The purpose of
            this interpolation of two words is clear. The Samaritan
            Ebionites, like the Essenes, did not touch meat, regarding all
            animal food with the greatest repugnance.<a id="noteref_233"
            name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> By
            the addition of two words they were able to convert the saying of
            our Lord into a sanction of their superstition. But this saying
            of Jesus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
            155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            is now found only in St. Luke's Gospel. It must have stood
            originally without the Μὴ and the κρέας in the Gospel of the
            Twelve.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another of
            their alterations of the Gospel was to the same intent. Instead
            of making St. John the Baptist eat locusts and wild honey, they
            gave him for his nourishment wild honey only, ἐγχρίδας, instead
            of ἀχρίδας and μελί ἄγριον.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage in
            which this curious change was made is remarkable. It served as
            the introduction to the Gospel in use among the Gnostic
            Ebionites.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

            Peter, and he said unto him, As I passed by the Sea of Tiberias,
            I chose John and James, the sons of Zebedee, Simon and Andrew,
            Thaddaeus, Simon Zelotes and Judas Iscariot; and thee, Matthew,
            when thou wast sitting at thy tax-gatherer's table, then I called
            thee, and thou didst follow me. And you do I choose to be my

            loins, and his meat was wild honey, and the taste thereof was as
            manna, and as a cake of oil.</span></span>”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently
            after this announcement of his choice of the apostles there
            followed something analogous to the preface in St. Luke's Gospel,
            to the effect that these apostles, having assembled together, had
            taken in hand to write down those things that they remembered
            concerning Christ and his teaching. And it was on this account
            that the Gospel obtained the name of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Recollections of the Apostles,”</span> or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of the

            notice taken of St. Matthew, who is singled out from the others

            between the Gospel and the converted publican. If we had the
            complete introduction, we should probably find that in it he was
            said to have been the scribe who wrote down the apostolic

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are a
            few fragments preserved by early ecclesiastical writers which we
            cannot say for certain belonged to the Gospel of the Hebrews, but
            which there is good reason to believe formed a part of it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Origen, in his
            Commentary on St. Matthew, quotes a saying of our Lord which is
            not to be found in the Canonical Gospels. Origen, we know, was
            acquainted with, and quoted respectfully, the Gospel of the
            Hebrews. It is therefore probable that this quotation is taken
            from it: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=

            probable. It is noteworthy that it is quoted in comment on St.
            Matthew's Gospel, the one to which the lost Gospel bore the
            closest resemblance, and one which Origen would probably consult

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The saying is
            so beautiful, and so truly describes the love of our Lord, that
            we must wish to believe it comes to us on such high authority as
            the Gospel of the Twelve.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another saying
            of Christ is quoted both by Clement of Alexandria and by Origen,
            without saying whence they drew it, but by both as undoubted
            sayings of the Saviour. It ran:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            things will be added to you.</span></span>”</span> <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
            seen, the form as given by St. Clement is better and simpler than
            that given by Origen. It is probable, however, that they both
            formed members of the same saying, following the usual Hebrew
            arrangement of repeating a maxim, giving it a slightly different
            turn, or a wider expansion. In two passages in other places
            Origen makes allusion to this saying without quoting it
            directly.<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Acts of
            the Apostles, St. Luke puts into the mouth of St. Paul a saying
            of Christ, which is not given by any evangelist, in these words:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
            how he said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">It is more blessed to give than to
            receive</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_238" name=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> It
            is curious that this saying should not have been inserted by St.
            Luke in his Gospel. Whether this saying found its way into the
            Hebrew Gospel it is impossible to tell.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Epistle
            of St. Barnabas another utterance of Christ is given. This
            Epistle is so distinctly of a Judaizing character, so manifestly
            belongs to the Nazarene <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg

            school, that such a reference in it makes it more than probable
            that it was taken from the Gospel received as Canonical among the
            Nazarenes. The saying of St. Barnabas is, <span class=

            profit us, if we have not in abhorrence the evil one and future

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the second
            Epistle of St. Clement of Rome to the Corinthians occurs a very
            striking passage: <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore to us doing
            such things the Lord said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">If ye were with me, gathered together in my
            bosom, and did not keep my commandments, I would cast you out,

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can well
            understand this occurring in an anti-Pauline Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again.

            ye fear them that kill you, and after that have nothing that they
            can do to you, but fear rather him who, after ye are dead, has
            power to cast your soul and body into hell

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
            clearly another version of the passage, Matt. x. 16-26. In one
            particular it is fuller than in the Canonical Gospel; it
            introduces St. Peter as speaking and drawing forth the
            exhortation not to fear those who kill the body only. But it is
            without the long exhortation contained in the 17-27th verses of
            St. Matthew.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another saying
            from the same source is, <span class="tei tei-q">“This,

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin Martyr
            contributes another saying. We have already seen that in all
            likelihood he quoted from the Gospel of the Hebrews, or the
            Recollections of the Twelve, as he called it. He says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“On this account also our Lord Jesus
            Christ said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Clement of Alexandria makes the same quotation, slightly varying
            the words. Justin and Clement apparently both translated from the
            original Hebrew, but did not give exactly the same rendering of
            words, though they gave the same sense.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">3. The Origin of the Gospel of the
            Hebrews.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We come now to
            a question delicate, and difficult to answer—the Origin of the
            Gospel of the Hebrews; delicate, because it involves another, the
            origin of the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark; difficult,
            because of the nature of the evidence on which we shall have to
            form our opinion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Because the
            Gospel of the Hebrews is not preserved, is not in the Canon, it
            does not follow that its value was slight, its accuracy doubtful.
            Its disappearance is due partly to the fact of its having been
            written in Aramaic, but chiefly to that of its having been in use
            by an Aramaic-speaking community which assumed first a
            schismatical, then a heretical position, so that the disfavour
            which fell on the Nazarene body enveloped and doomed its Gospel
            as well.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The four
            Canonical Gospels owe their preservation to their having been in
            use among those Christian communities which coalesced under the
            moulding hands of St. John. Those parties which were reluctant to
            abandon their peculiar features were looked upon with coldness,
            then aversion, lastly abhorrence. They became more and more
            isolated, eccentric, prejudiced, impracticable. Whilst the Church
            asserted her catholicity, organized her constitution, established
            her canon, formulated her creed, adapted herself to the flux of
            ideas, these narrow <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
            161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            sects spent their petty lives in accentuating their peculiarities
            till they grew into monstrosities; and when they fell and
            disappeared, there fell and disappeared with them those precious
            records of the Saviour's words and works which they had
            preserved.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hebrew
            Gospel was closely related to the Gospel of St. Matthew; that we
            know from the testimony of St. Jerome, who saw, copied and
            translated it. That it was not identical with the Canonical first
            Gospel is also certain. Sufficient fragments have been preserved
            to show that in many points it was fuller, in some less complete,
            than the Greek Gospel of St. Matthew. The two Gospels were twin
            sisters speaking different tongues. Was the Greek of the first
            Gospel acquired, or was it original? This is a point deserving of
            investigation before we fix the origin and determine the
            construction of the Hebrew Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to a
            fragment of a lost work by Papias, written about the middle of
            the second century, under the title of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Commentary on the Sayings of the Lord,”</span><a id=
            "noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a> the
            apostle Matthew was the author of a collection of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sayings,”</span> λόγια, of our blessed
            Lord. The passage has been already given, but it is necessary to
            quote it again here: <span class="tei tei-q">“Matthew wrote in
            the Hebrew dialect the sayings, and every one interpreted them as
            best he was able.”</span><a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248"

            These <span class="tei tei-q">“logia”</span> could only be,
            according to the signification of the word (Rom. iii. 2; Heb. v.
            12; Pet. iv. 11; Acts vii. 38), a collection of the sayings of
            the Saviour that were regarded as oracular, as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the words of God.”</span> That they were the words
            of Jesus, follows from the title given by Papias to his
            commentary, Λόγια κυριακὰ.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This brief
            notice is sufficient to show that Matthew's collection was not
            the Gospel as it now stands. It was no collection of the acts, no
            biography, of the Saviour; it was solely a collection of his
            discourses.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is made
            clearer by what Papias says in the same work on St. Mark. He
            relates that the latter wrote not only what Jesus had <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">said</span></em>,
            but also what he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            whereas St. Matthew wrote only what had been <em class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work of
            Matthew, therefore, contained no doings, πραχθέντα, but only
            sayings, λεχθέντα, which were, according to Papias, written in

            and which were translated into Greek by every one as best he was

            That this John was the apostle is not certain. It was questioned
            by Eusebius in his mention of the Prooemium of Papias. John the
            priest and John the apostle were both at Ephesus, and both lived
            there at the close of the first century. Some have thought the
            Apocalypse to have been the work of the priest John, and not of
            the apostle. Others have supposed that there was only one John.
            However this may be, it is certain that Papias lived at a time
            when it was possible to obtain correct information relating to
            the origin of the sacred books in use among the Christians.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
            the Prooemium of Papias, which Eusebius has preserved, the Bishop
            of Hierapolis had obtained his knowledge, not directly from the
            apostles, nor from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg
            163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the apostle John, but from the mouths of men who had companied
            with old priests and disciples of the apostles, and who had
            related to him what Andrew, Peter, Philip, Thomas, James, John
            and other disciples of the Lord had said (εἶπεν). Besides the
            testimony of these priests, Papias appealed further to the
            evidence of Aristion and the priest John, disciples of the
            Lord,<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href=
            "#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a>
            still alive and bearing testimony when he wrote. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“And,”</span> says Papias, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
            do not think that I derived so much benefit from books as from
            the living voice of those that are still surviving.”</span><a id=
            "noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Papias,
            therefore, had his information about the apostles second-hand,
            from those <span class="tei tei-q">“who followed them
            about.”</span> Nevertheless, his evidence is quite trustworthy.
            He takes pains to inform us that he used great precaution to
            obtain the truth about every particular he stated, and the means
            of obtaining the truth were at his disposal. That Papias was a
            man <span class="tei tei-q">“of a limited
            comprehension”</span><a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href=
            "#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a>
            does not affect the trustworthiness of his statement. Eusebius
            thus designates him because he believed in the Millennium; but so
            did most of the Christians of the first age, as well as in the
            immediate second coming of Christ, till undeceived by events.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The statement
            of Papias does not justify us in supposing that Matthew wrote the
            Gospel in Hebrew, but only a collection of the logia, the sayings
            of Jesus. Eusebius did not mistake the Sayings for the Gospel,
            for he speaks separately of the Hebrew Gospel,<a id="noteref_256"
            name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>
            without connecting it in any way with the testimony of
            Papias.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
            Eusebius, Papias wrote his Commentary in five books.<a id=
            "noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> It
            is not improbable, therefore, that the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Logia”</span> were
            broken into five parts or grouped in five discourses, and that he
            wrote an explanation of each discourse in a separate book or
            chapter.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The statement
            of Papias, if it does not refer to the Gospel of St. Matthew as
            it now stands, does refer to one of the constituent parts of that
            Gospel, and does explain much that would be otherwise
            inexplicable.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. St.
            Matthew's Gospel differs from St. Mark's in that it contains long
            discourses, sayings and parables, which are wanting or only given
            in a brief form in the second Canonical Gospel. It is therefore
            probable that in its composition were used the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Logia of the Lord,”</span> written by Matthew.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. If the
            collection of <span class="tei tei-q">“Sayings of the
            Lord”</span> consisted, as has been suggested, of five parts,
            then we find traces in the Canonical Matthew of five groups of
            discourses, concluded by the same formulary: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these
            sayings”</span> (τοὺς λόγους τούτους), or <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“parables,”</span> vii. 28, xi. 1, xiii. 53,. xix. 1,
            xxvi. 1. It is not, however, possible to restore all the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“logia”</span> to their primitive
            positions, for they have been dispersed through the Canonical
            Gospel, and arranged in connection with the events which called
            them forth. In the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sayings of the
            Lord”</span> of Matthew, these events were not narrated; but all
            the sayings were placed together, like the proverbs in the book
            of Solomon.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Logia”</span> of the Lord were written
            by Matthew in Hebrew, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> in the vernacular
            Aramaic. If they have formed the groundwork, or a composite part
            of the Canonical Gospel, we are likely to detect in the Greek
            some traces of their origin. And this, in fact, we are able to
            do.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">α. In the
            first place, we have the introduction of <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>
            Many others might be cited, but these will suffice.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">β. Next, we
            have the use of illustrations which are only comprehensible by
            Hebrews, as <span class="tei tei-q">“One jot and one tittle shall
            in no wise fall.”</span> The Ἰῶτα of the Greek text is the
            Aramaic Jod (v. 18); but the <span class="tei tei-q">“one
            tittle”</span> is more remarkable. In the Greek it is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“one horn,”</span> or <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“stroke.”</span><a id="noteref_262" name=
            "noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> The
            idea is taken from the Aramaic orthography. A stroke
            distinguishes one consonant from another, as ח and ה from ד. With
            this the Greeks had nothing that corresponded.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">γ. We find
            Hebraisms in great number in the discourses of our Lord given by
            St. Matthew.<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href=
            "#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">δ. We find
            mistranslations. The Greek Canonical text gives a wrong meaning,
            or no meaning at all, through misunderstanding of the Aramaic. By
            restoration of the Aramaic text we can rectify the translation.
            Thus:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. vii. 6,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Give not that which is holy to dogs,
            neither cast ye your pearls before swine.”</span> The word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“holy,”</span> τὸ ἅγιον, is a
            misinterpretation of the Aramaic קרשא, a gold jewel for the ear,
            head or neck.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href=
            "#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> The
            translator mistook the word for קורשא, or קרשא without ו
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the holy.”</span> The sentence in the
            original therefore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg
            166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            ran, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give not a gold jewel to dogs,
            neither cast pearls before swine.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. v. 37,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let your conversation be Yea, yea, Nay,
            nay.”</span> This is meaningless. But if we restore the
            construction in Aramaic we have יהןא לכם הן הן, לאו לאו, and the
            meaning is, <span class="tei tei-q">“In your conversation let
            your yea be yea, and your nay be nay.”</span> The yea, yea, and
            nay, nay, in the Hebrew come together, and this misled the
            translator. St. James quotes the saying rightly (v. 12),
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay;
            lest ye fall into condemnation.”</span> It is a form of a
            Rabbinic maxim, <span class="tei tei-q">“The yea of the righteous
            is yea, and their nay is nay.”</span> It is an injunction to
            speak the truth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have
            therefore good grounds for our conjecture that St. Matthew's
            genuine <span class="tei tei-q">“Sayings of the Lord”</span> form
            a part of the Canonical Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have next
            to consider, Whence came the rest of the material, the record of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“doings of the Lord,”</span> which
            the compiler interwove with the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Sayings”</span>?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have
            tolerably convincing evidence that the compiler placed under
            contribution both Aramaic and Greek collections.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the
            citations from the Old Testament are not taken exclusively from
            the Hebrew Scriptures, nor from the Greek translation of the
            Seventy; but some are taken from the Greek translation, and some
            are taken from the Hebrew, or from a Syro-Chaldaean Targum or
            Paraphrase, probably in use at the time.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. i. 23,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“A virgin shall be with child, and shall
            bring forth a son.”</span> This is quoted as a prophecy of the
            miraculous conception. But it is only a prophecy in the version
            of the LXX., which renders the Hebrew word παρθένος, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“virgin.”</span> The Hebrew word does not mean virgin
            exclusively, but <span class="tei tei-q">“a young woman.”</span>
            We may therefore conclude that verses 22, 23, were additions by
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name=
            "Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Greek compiler
            of the Gospel, unacquainted with the original Hebrew text.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. ii. 15,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of Egypt have I called my
            son.”</span> This is quoted literally from the Hebrew text. That
            of the LXX. has, <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of Egypt have I
            called my children,”</span> τὰ τέκνα. This made the saying of
            Hosea no prophecy of our Lord; consequently he who inserted this
            reference can have known only the Hebrew text, and not the Greek
            version. But in ii. 18, the compiler follows the LXX. And again,
            ii. 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall be called a
            Nazarene,”</span> Ναζωραῖος. The Hebrew is כזר of which Ναζωραῖος
            is no translation. The LXX. have Ναζιραῖος. The compiler was
            caught by the similarity of sounds.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. iii. 3.
            Here the construction of the LXX. is followed, which unites
            <span class="tei tei-q">“in the wilderness”</span> with
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the voice of one crying.”</span> The
            Hebrew was therefore not known by the compiler.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. iv. 15.
            Here the LXX. is not followed, for the word γῆ is used in place
            of χώρα. The quotation is not, moreover, taken exactly from
            Isaiah, but apparently from a Targum.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. viii.
            17. This quotation is nearer the original Hebrew than the
            rendering of the LXX.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. xii.
            18-21. In this citation we have an incorrect rendering of the
            Hebrew לתורתו <span class="tei tei-q">“at his teaching,”</span>
            made by the LXX. <span class="tei tei-q">“in his name,”</span>
            adopted without hesitation by the compiler. He also accepts the
            erroneous rendering of <span class="tei tei-q">“islands,”</span>
            made <span class="tei tei-q">“nation,”</span> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Gentiles,”</span> by the LXX.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, on the
            other hand, <span class="tei tei-q">“till he send forth judgment
            unto victory,”</span> is taken from neither the original Hebrew
            nor from the LXX., and is probably derived from a Targum.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in this
            passage we have apparently a combination <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of two somewhat similar accounts—the one in
            Greek, the other in Aramaic.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. xiii.
            35. This also is a compound text. The first half is from the
            LXX., but the second member is from a Hebrew Targum.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matt. xxvii.
            3. In the Hebrew, the field is not a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“potter's,”</span> nor is it in the LXX., who use
            χωνευτήριον <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            smelting-furnace.”</span> The word in the Hebrew signifies
            <span class="tei tei-q">“treasury.”</span> The composer of the
            Gospel, therefore must have quoted from a Targum, and been
            ignorant both of the genuine Hebrew Scriptures and of the Greek
            translation of the Seventy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            instances are enough to show that the material used for the
            compilation of the first Canonical Gospel was very various; that
            the author had at his disposal matter in both Aramaic and
            Greek.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall find,
            on looking further, that he inserted two narratives of the same
            event in his Gospel in different places, if they differed
            slightly from one another, when coming to him from different
            sources.</p>

            many incidents which point to St. Peter as the authority for

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this
            belong—the manner in which the Gospel opens with the baptism of
            John, just as St. Peter's address (Acts x. 37-41) begins with
            that event also; the many little incidents mentioned which give
            token of having been related by an eye-witness, and in which the
            narrative of St. Matthew is deficient.<a id="noteref_271" name=

            174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Gospel is also rich in indications of the feelings of the people
            toward Jesus, such as an eye-witness must have observed,<a id=
            "noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a> and
            of notices of movements of the body—small significant acts, which
            could not escape one present who described what he had
            seen.<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
            composer of St. Matthew's Gospel made use of the material out of
            which St. Mark compiled his, that is, of the memorabilia of St.
            Peter, is evident. Whole passages of St. Mark's Gospel occur word
            for word, or nearly so, in the Gospel of St. Matthew.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, it
            is apparent that sometimes the author of St. Matthew's Gospel
            misunderstood the text. A few instances must suffice here.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark ii. 18:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“And the disciples of John and of the
            Pharisees were fasting. And they came to him and said to him, Why
            do the disciples of John, and the disciples of the Pharisees,
            fast, and thy disciples fast not?”</span> It is clear that it was
            then a fasting season, which the disciples of Jesus were not
            observing. The <span class="tei tei-q">“they”</span> who came to
            him does not mean <span class="tei tei-q">“the disciples
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name=
            "Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of John and of the
            Pharisees,”</span> but certain other persons. Καὶ ἔρχονται is so
            used in St. Mark's Gospel in several places, like the French
            <span class="tei tei-q">“on venait.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
            compiler of St. Matthew's Gospel did not understand this use of
            the verb without a subject expressed, and he made <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the disciples of John”</span> ask the question.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark vi. 10:
            Ὅπου ἂν εἰσέλθητε εἰς οἰκίαν, ἐκεῖ μένετε ἕως ἄν ἐξέλθητε
            ἐκεῖθεν. That is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherever (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            in whatsoever town or village) ye enter into a house, therein
            remain (i.e. in that house) till ye go away thence (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            from that city or village).”</span> By leaving out the word
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">house</span></em>, Matthew loses the sense
            of the command (x. 11), <span class="tei tei-q">“Into whatsoever
            town or village ye enter—remain in it till ye go out of
            it.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark vii. 27,
            28. The Lord answers the Syro-Phoenician woman, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet
            to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the
            dogs.”</span> The woman answers, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,
            Lord; yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's
            crumbs.”</span> The meaning is, God gives His grace and mercy
            first to the Jews (the children); and this must not be taken from
            the Jews to be given to the heathen (the dogs). True, answers the
            woman; but the heathen do partake of the blessings that overflow
            from the portion of the Jews.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
            so-called Matthew did not catch the signification, and the point
            is lost in his version (xv. 27). He makes the woman answer,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
            from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            table.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark x. 13.
            According to St. Mark, parents brought their children to Christ,
            probably with some superstitious idea, to be touched. This
            offended the disciples. <span class="tei tei-q">“They rebuked
            those that brought them.”</span> But Jesus was displeased, and
            said to the disciples, <span class="tei tei-q">“Suffer the little
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name=
            "Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> children to come
            unto me.”</span> And instead of fulfilling the superstitious
            wishes of the parents, he took the children in his arms and
            blessed them. But the text used by St. Matthew's compilator was
            probably defective at the end of verse 13, and ended,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“and his disciples rebuked....”</span>
            The compiler therefore completed it with αὐτοῖς instead of τοῖς
            προσφέρουσιν, and then misunderstood verse 14, and applied the
            ἄφετε differently: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let go the children,
            and do not hinder them from coming to me.”</span> In St. Mark,
            the disciples rebuke the parents; in St. Matthew, they rebuke the
            children, and intercept them on their way to Christ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark xii. 8:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They slew him and cast him out,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> cast out the dead body.
            The compiler of St. Matthew's Gospel did not see this. He could
            not understand how that the son was killed and then cast out of
            the vineyard; so he altered the order into, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“They cast him out and slew him”</span> (xxi.
            38).<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Examples might
            be multiplied, but these must suffice. If I am not mistaken, they
            go far to prove that the author of St. Matthew's Gospel used the
            material, or some of the material, out of which St. Mark's Gospel
            was composed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there are
            also other proofs. The text of St. Mark has been taken into that
            of St. Matthew's Gospel, but not without some changes,
            corrections which the compiler made, thinking the words of the
            text in his hands were redundant, vulgar, or not sufficiently
            explicit.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus Mark i.
            5: <span class="tei tei-q">“The whole Jewish land and all they of

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark iii. 4:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He saith, Is it lawful to do good on the
            Sabbath-days, or to do evil?”</span> In St. Matthew's Gospel,
            before performing a miracle, Christ argues the necessity of
            showing mercy on the Sabbath-day, and supplies what is wanting in
            St. Mark—the conclusion, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore it is
            lawful to do well on the Sabbath-days”</span> (xii. 12).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark iv. 12:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“That seeing they might not see, and
            hearing they might not hear.”</span> This seemed harsh to the
            compiler of St. Matthew. It was as if unbelief and blindness were
            fatally imposed by God on men. He therefore alters the tenor of
            the passage, and attributes the blindness of the people, and
            their incapability of understanding, to their own grossness of
            heart (xiii. 14, 15).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark v. 37:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The ship was freighted,”</span> in St.

            covered”</span> with the waves (viii. 34).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark vi. 9
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Money in the girdle,”</span> changed
            into, <span class="tei tei-q">“money in the girdles”</span> (x.
            9).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark ix. 42:

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sell all thou hast;”</span> Matt. xix.
            21, <span class="tei tei-q">“all thy possessions.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark xii. 30:

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if it be
            evident that the author of St. Matthew's Gospel laid under
            contribution the material used by St. Mark, it is also clear that
            he did not use St. Mark's Gospel as it stands. He had the
            fragmentary memorabilia of which it was made up, or a large
            number of them, but unarranged. He sorted them and wove them
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name=
            "Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in with the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Logia”</span> written by St. Matthew,
            and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">afterwards</span></em>, independently,
            without knowledge, probably, of what had been done by the
            compiler of the first Gospel, St. Mark compiled his. Thus St.
            Matthew's is the first Gospel in order of composition, though
            much of the material of St. Mark's Gospel was written and in
            circulation first.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This will
            appear when we see how independently of one another the compiler
            of St. Matthew and St. Mark arrange their <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“memorabilia.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            unnecessary to do more to illustrate this than to take the
            contents of Matt. iv.—xiii.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
            St. Matthew, after the Sermon on the Mount, Christ heals the
            leper, then enters Capernaum, where he receives the prayer of the
            centurion, and forthwith enters into Peter's house, where he
            cures the mother-in-law, and the same night crosses the sea.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But according
            to St. Mark, Christ cast out the unclean spirit in the synagogue
            at Capernaum, then healed Peter's wife's mother, and, not the
            same night but long after, crossed the sea. On his return he went
            through the villages preaching, and then healed the leper.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The accounts
            are the same, but the order is altogether different. The
            deutero-Matthew must have had the material used by Mark under his
            eye, for he adopts it into his narrative; but he cannot have had
            St. Mark's Gospel, or he would not have so violently disturbed
            the order of events.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The compiler
            has been guilty of an inaccuracy in the use of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Gergesenes”</span> instead of Gadarenes. St. Mark is
            right. Gadara was situated near the river Hieromax, east of the
            Sea of Galilee, over against Scythopolis and Tiberias, and
            capital of Peraea. This agrees exactly with what is said in the
            Gospels of the miracle performed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> in the <span class="tei tei-q">“country of
            the Gadarenes.”</span> The swine rushed violently down a steep
            place and perished in the lake. Jesus had come from the N.W.
            shore of the Sea to Gadara in the S.E. But the country of the
            Gergesenes can hardly be the same as that of the Gadarenes.
            Gerasa, the capital, was on the Jabbok, some days' journey
            distant from the lake. The deutero-Matthew was therefore ignorant
            of the topography of the neighbourhood whence Levi, that is
            Matthew, was called.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Mark says
            that Christ healed one demoniac in the synagogue of Capernaum,
            then crossed the lake, and healed the second in Gadara. But St.
            Matthew, or rather the Greek compiler of St. Matthew's Gospel,
            has fused these two events into one, and makes Christ heal both
            possessed men in the country of the Gergesenes. In like manner we
            have twice the healing of two blind men (ix. 27 and xx. 30),
            whereas the other evangelists know of only single blind men being
            healed on both occasions. How comes this? The compiler had two
            accounts of each miracle of healing the blind, slightly varying.
            He thought they referred to the same occasion, but to different
            persons, and therefore made Christ heal two men, whereas he had
            given sight to but one.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the former
            case the compiler had not such a circumstantial account of the
            restoration to sound mind of the demoniac in the synagogue as St.
            Mark had received from St. Peter. He knew only that on the
            occasion of Christ's visit to the Sea of Tiberias he had
            recovered two men who were possessed, and so he made the healing
            of both take place simultaneously at the same spot.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An equally
            remarkable instance of the fact that St. Matthew's Gospel was
            made up of fragmentary <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“recollections”</span> by various eye-witnesses, is
            that of the dumb man possessed with a devil, in ix. 32. At
            Capernaum, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg
            180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            after having restored Jairus' daughter to life and healed the two
            blind men, the same day the dumb man is brought to him. The devil
            is cast out, the dumb speaks, and the Pharisees say, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“He casteth out devils through the prince of the
            devils.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
            exactly the same account which has been used by St. Luke (xi.
            14). But in xii. 22 we have the same incident over again. There
            is brought unto Christ one possessed with a devil, blind and
            dumb; him Christ heals; whereupon the Pharisees say, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“This fellow doth not cast out devils but by
            Beelzebub the prince of the devils.”</span> Then follows the
            solemn warning against blasphemy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear
            that the Greek compiler of St. Matthew's Gospel must have had two
            independent accounts of this miracle, one with the warning
            against blasphemy appended to it, the other without. He gives
            both accounts, one as occurring at Capernaum, the other much
            later, after Jesus had gone about Galilee preaching, and the
            Pharisees had conspired against him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Matthew
            says that after the healing of Peter's wife's mother, Jesus, that
            same evening, cured many sick, and in the night crossed to the
            country of the Gergesenes. But St. Mark says that he remained
            that night at Capernaum, and rose early next morning before day,
            and went into a solitary place. According to him, this crossing
            over the sea did not occur till long after.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The order in
            St. Luke is again different. Jesus calls Levi, chooses the
            Twelve, preaches the sermon on the plain, heals the Centurion's
            servant, goes then from place to place preaching. Then occurs the
            storm on the lake, and after having healed the demoniac Jesus
            returns to Capernaum, cures the woman with the bloody flux,
            raises Jairus' daughter and sends out the Twelve.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Gospel
            of St. Mark, the parable of the sower is spoken on <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the same day”</span> on which, in the evening, Jesus
            crosses the lake in a storm.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Gospel
            of St. Matthew, this parable is spoken long after, on
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the same day”</span> as his mother and
            brethren seek him, and this is after he has been in the country
            of the Gadarenes, has returned to Capernaum, gone about Galilee
            preaching, come back again to Capernaum, but has been driven away
            again by the conspiracy of the Pharisees.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would
            appear from an examination of the two Gospels that articles 23,
            24 and 25 composed one document, for both St. Matthew and St.
            Mark used it as it is, in a block, only they differ as to where
            to build it in.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">19, 20 and 21
            formed another block of Apostolic Memorabilia, and was built in
            by the deutero-Matthew in one place and by St. Mark in another. 5
            and 6, and again 9 and 10, were smaller compound recollections
            which the compiler of St. Matthew's Gospel and St. Mark obtained
            in their concrete forms. On the other hand, 3 and 16 formed
            recollections consisting of but one member, and are thrust into
            the narrative where the two compilers severally thought most
            suitable. We are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg

            therefore led by the comparison of the order in which events in
            our Lord's life are related by St. Matthew and St. Mark, to the
            conclusion, that the author of the first Gospel as it stands had
            not St. Mark's Gospel in its complete form before him when he
            composed his record.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have yet
            another proof that this was so.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Matthew's
            Gospel is not so full in its account of some incidents in our
            Lord's life as is the Gospel of St. Mark.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The compiler
            of the first Gospel has shown throughout his work the greatest
            anxiety to insert every particular he could gather relating to
            the doings and sayings of Jesus. This has led him into
            introducing the same event or saying over a second time if he
            found more than one version of it. Had he all the material
            collected in St. Mark's Gospel at his disposal, he would not have
            omitted any of it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we do not
            find in St. Matthew's Gospel the following passages:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark iv.
            26-29, the parable of the seed springing up, a type of the growth
            of the Gospel without further labour to the minister than that of
            spreading it abroad. The meaning of this parable is different
            from that in Matt. xii. 24-30, and therefore the two parables are
            not to be regarded as identical.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark viii.
            22-26. By omitting the narrative of what took place at Bethsaida,
            an apparent gap occurs in the account of St. Matthew after xvi.
            4-12. The journey across the sea leads one to expect that Christ
            and his disciples will land somewhere on the coast. But Matthew,
            without any mention of a landing at Bethsaida, translates Jesus
            and the apostolic band to Caesarea Philippi. But in Mark, Jesus

            Philippi (viii. 27). That the compiler of the first Gospel should

            39. In St. Matthew's collection of the Logia of our Lord there

            "tei tei-q">“He that is not with me is against me”</span> (Matt.
            xii. 30). St. Mark narrates the circumstances which called forth
            this remark. But the deutero-Matthew evidently did not know of
            these circumstances; he therefore leaves the saying in his record
            without explanation.<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href=

            possible that he could have omitted such an exquisite anecdote
            had he possessed it?</p>

            which so unmistakably exhibits the narrative to have been the
            record of some eye-witness of the scene, is omitted in St.
            Matthew. On this no stress, however, can be laid. The

            been said to show conclusively that the deutero-Matthew, if we
            may so term the compiler of the first Canonical Gospel, had not
            St. Mark's Gospel before him when he wrote his own, that he did
            not cut up the Gospel of Mark, and work the shreds into his own

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both Gospels
            are mosaics, composed in the same way. But the Gospel of St. Mark
            was composed only of the <span class=

            St. Matthew was more composite. Some of the pieces which were
            used by Mark were used also by the deutero-Matthew. This is
            patent: how it was so needs explanation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
            that when the apostles founded churches, their instructions on
            the sayings and doings of Jesus were taken down, and in the
            absence of the apostles were read by the president of the
            congregation. The Epistles which they sent were, we know, so
            read,<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href=
            "#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> But
            what was far more precious to the early believers than any
            letters of the apostles about the regulation of controversies,
            were their recollections of the Lord, their Memorabilia, as
            Justin calls them. The earliest records show us the Gospels read
            at the celebration of the Eucharist.<a id="noteref_279" name=

            ancient Gospels were not divided into chapters, but into the
            portions read on Sundays and festivals, like our <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Church Services.”</span> Thus the Peschito version
            in use in the Syrian churches was divided in this manner:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fifth day of the week of the
            Candidates”</span> (Matt. ix. 5-17), <span class="tei tei-q">“For

            "tei tei-q">“Friday in the fifth week in the Fast”</span>
            (27-38), <span class="tei tei-q">“For the commemoration of the
            Holy Apostles”</span> (36-38, x. 1-15), <span class=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lesson for the Dead”</span> (34-42),

            1-15), <span class="tei tei-q">“Second day in the third week of
            the Fast”</span> (16-24).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these
            fragmentary records St. Luke alludes when he says that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“many had taken in hand to arrange in a
            consecutive account (ἀνατάξασθαι διήγησιν) those things which
            were most fully believed”</span> amongst the faithful. These he
            <span class="tei tei-q">“traced up from the beginning accurately
            one after another”</span> (παρηκολουθηκότι ἄνωθεν πᾶσιν ἀκριβῶς
            καθεξῆς). Here we have clearly the existence of records
            disconnected originally, which many strung together in
            consecutive order, and St. Luke takes pains, as he tells us, to
            make this order chronological.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some Churches
            had certain Memorabilia, others had a different set. That of
            Antioch had the recollections of St. Peter, that of Jerusalem the
            recollections of St. James, St. Simeon and St. Jude. St. Luke
            indicates the source whence he drew his account of the nativity
            and early years of the Lord,—the recollections of St. Mary, the
            Virgin Mother, communicated to him orally. He speaks of the
            Blessed Virgin as keeping the things that happened in her heart
            and pondering on them.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280"
            href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            Another time it is contemporaries, Mary certainly included.<a id=

            both occasions it is in reference to events connected with our
            Lord's infancy. Why did he thus insist on her having taken pains
            to remember these things? Surely to show whence he drew his
            information. He narrates these events on the testimony of her
            word; and her word is to be relied on; for these things, he
            assures us, were deeply impressed on her memory.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Memorabilia”</span> in use in the
            different Churches founded by the apostles would probably be
            strung together in such order as they were generally read. How
            early the Church began to have a regulated order of seasons, an
            ecclesiastical year, cannot be ascertained <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id=
            "Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with certainty; but every
            consideration leads us to suspect that it grew up simultaneously
            with the constitution of the Church. With the Church of the
            Hebrews this was unquestionably the case. The Jews who believed
            had grown up under a system of fasts and festivals in regular
            series, and, as we know, they observed these even after they were
            believers in Christ. Paul, who broke with the Law in so many
            points, did not venture to dispense with its sacred cycle of
            festivals. He hasted to Jerusalem to attend the feast of
            Pentecost.<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href=
            "#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a> At
            Ephesus, even, he observed it.<a id="noteref_283" name=

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> St.
            Jerome assures us that Lent was instituted by the apostles.<a id=
            "noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> The
            Apostolic Constitutions order the observance of the Sabbath, the
            Lord's-day, Pentecost, Christmas, Epiphany, the days of the
            Apostles, that of St. Stephen, and the anniversaries of the
            Martyrs.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href=
            "#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>
            Indeed, the observance of the Lord's-day, instituted probably by
            St. Paul, involves the principle which would include all other
            sacred commemorations; for if one day was to be set apart as a
            memorial of the resurrection, it is probable that others would be
            observed in memory of the nativity, the passion, the ascension,
            &amp;c.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As early as
            there was any sort of ecclesiastical year observed, so early
            would the <span class="tei tei-q">“Memorabilia”</span> of the
            apostles be arranged as appropriate to these seasons. But such an
            arrangement would not be chronological; therefore many took in
            hand, as St. Luke tells us, to correct this, and he took special
            care to give the succession of events as they occurred, not as
            they were read, by obtaining information from the best sources
            available.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
            that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Recollections”</span> of St.
            Peter, written in disjointed notes by St. Mark, were in
            circulation through many Churches before St. Mark composed

            "Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his Gospel out of
            them. From Antioch to Rome they were read at the celebration of
            the divine mysteries; and some of them, found in the Churches of
            Asia Minor, have been taken by St. Luke into his Gospel. Others
            circulating in Palestine were in the hands of the
            deutero-Matthew, and grafted into his compilation. But as St.
            Luke, St. Mark, and the composer of the first Gospel, acted
            independently, their chronological sequences differ. Their
            Gospels are three kaleidoscopic groups of the same pieces.<a id=

            that the Synoptical Gospels were composed of various disconnected
            materials, variously united into consecutive biographies, was
            accepted by Bishop Marsh, and it is the only theory which

            making <span class="tei tei-q">“harmonies”</span> of the Gospels.
            If we adopt the received popular conception of the composition of

            consensu Evangelistarum,”</span> and in his effort to force them
            into agreement was driven to strange suppositions—as that when
            our Lord went through Jericho there was a blind man by the
            road-side leading into the city, and another by the road-side
            leading out of it, and that both were healed under very similar
            circumstances.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apollinaris,
            in the famous controversy about Easter, declared that it was
            irreconcilable with the Law that Christ should have suffered on
            the great feast-day, as related by St. Matthew, but that the
            Gospels disagreed among themselves on the day upon which he
            suffered.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such an
            admission as that the Synoptical Gospels were composed in the
            manner I have pointed out, in no way affects their incomparable
            value. They exhibit to us as in a mirror what the apostles taught
            and what their disciples believed. Faith does not depend on the
            chronological sequence of events, but on the verity of those
            events. <span class="tei tei-q">“See!”</span> exclaimed St.
            Chrysostom, <span class="tei tei-q">“how through the
            contradictions in the evangelical history in minor particulars,
            the truth of the main facts transpires, and the trustworthiness
            of the authors is made manifest!”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In everything,
            both human and divine, there is an <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            supreme importance, and of fallibility in that which concerns not
            salvation. The lenses through which the light of the world shone
            to remote ages were human scribes liable to error. Θεῖα πάντα καὶ
            ἀνθρώπινα πάντα, was the motto Tholuck inscribed on his copy of
            the Sacred Oracles.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having
            established the origin of the Gospel of St. Matthew, we are able
            now to see our way to establishing that of the Gospel of the
            Twelve, or Gospel of the Hebrews.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No doubt it
            also was a mosaic made out of the same materials as the Gospel of
            St. Matthew. There subsisted side by side in Palestine a
            Greek-speaking and an Aramaic-speaking community of Christians,
            the one composed of proselytes from among the Gentiles, the other
            of converts from among the Jews. This Gentile Church in Palestine
            was scarcely influenced by St. Paul; it was under the rule of St.
            Peter, and therefore was more united to the Church at Jerusalem
            in habits of thought, in religious customs, in reverence for the
            Law, than the Churches of <span class="tei tei-q">“Asia”</span>
            and Greece. There was no antagonism between them. There was, on
            the contrary, close intercourse and mutual sympathy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each
            community, probably, had its own copies of Apostolic Memorabilia,
            not identical, but similar. Some of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“recollections”</span> were perhaps written only in
            Aramaic, or only in Greek, so that the collection of one
            community may have been more complete in some particulars than
            the collection of the other. The necessity to consolidate these
            Memorabilia into a consecutive narrative became obvious to both
            communities, and each composed <span class="tei tei-q">“in
            order”</span> the scraps of record of our Lord's sayings and
            doings they possessed and read in their sacred mysteries. St.
            Matthew's <span class="tei tei-q">“Logia of the Lord”</span> was
            used in the compilation of the Hebrew Gospel; one of the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name=
            "Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> translations of
            it, which, according to Papias, were numerous, formed the basis
            also of the Greek Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The material
            used by both communities, the motive actuating both communities,
            were the same; the results were consequently similar. That they
            were not absolutely identical was the consequence of their having
            been compiled independently.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
            resemblance was sufficient to make St. Jerome suppose the Hebrew
            Gospel to be the same as the Greek first Gospel; nevertheless,
            the differences were as great as has been pointed out in the
            preceding pages.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now
          considered all the fragments of the Gospel of the Hebrews that have
          been preserved to us in the writings of Justin Martyr, Origen,
          Jerome and Epiphanius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
          another storehouse of texts and references to a Gospel regarded as
          canonical at a very early date by the Nazarene or Ebionite Church.
          This storehouse is that curious collection of the sayings and
          doings of St. Peter, the Clementine Recognitions and Homilies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the Gospel
          used by the author or authors of the Clementines was that of the
          Hebrews cannot be shown; but it is probable that it was so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Clementines
          were a production of the Judaizing party in the Primitive Church,
          and it was this party which, we know, used the Gospel of the
          Twelve, or of the Hebrews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctrine in
          the Clementine Recognitions and Homilies bears close relations to
          that of the Jewish Essenes. The sacrificial system of the Jewish
          Church is rejected. It was not part of the revelation to Moses, but
          a tradition of the elders.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Distinction in
          meats is an essential element of religion. Through unclean meats

          places men in the power of evil spirits, who lead them to

          neglect of this distinction. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
          beginning of the world men lived long, and had no diseases. But

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rejection of
          sacrifices obliged the Nazarene Church to discriminate between what
          is true and false in the Scriptures; and, with the Essenes, they
          professed liberty to judge the Scriptures and reject what opposed
          their ideas. Thus they refused to acknowledge that <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moral
          teaching of the Clementines is of the most exalted nature. Chastity

          Poverty is elevated into an essential element of virtue. Property

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ebionites
          looked upon Christ as the Messiah rather than as God incarnate.
          They gave him the title of Son of God, and claimed for him the
          highest honour, but hesitated to term him God. In their earnest
          maintenance of the Unity of the Godhead against Gnosticism, they
          shrank from appearing to divide the Godhead. Thus, in the
          Clementines, St. Peter says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Our Lord
          neither asserted that there were gods except the Creator of all,
          nor did he proclaim himself to be God, but he pronounced him
          blessed who called him the Son of that God who ordered the
          universe.”</span><a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ebionitism
          of the Clementines is controversial. It was placed face to face
          with Gnosticism. Simon Magus, the representative of Gnosticism, as
          St. Peter is the representative of orthodoxy, in the Recognitions
          and Homilies, contends that the God of the Jews, the Demiurge, the
          Creator of the world, is evil. He attempts to prove this by showing
          that the world is full of pain <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and misery. The imperfections of the world
          are tokens of imperfection in the Creator. He takes the Old
          Testament. He shows from texts that the God of the Jews is
          represented as angry, jealous, repentant; that those whom He
          favours are incestuous, adulterers, murderers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This doctrine
          St. Peter combats by showing that present evils are educative,
          curative, disguised blessings; and by calling all those passages in
          Scripture which attribute to God human passions, corruptions of the
          sacred text in one of its many re-editions. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“God who created the world has not in reality such a
          character as the Scriptures assign Him,”</span> says St. Peter;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“for such a character is contrary to the
          nature of God, and therefore manifestly is falsely attributed to
          Him.”</span><a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href=
          "#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this brief
          sketch of the doctrines of the Ebionite Church from which the
          Clementines emanated, it will be seen that its Gospel must have
          resembled that of the Hebrews, or have been founded on it. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Recollections of the Twelve”</span>
          probably existed in several forms, some more complete than others,
          some purposely corrupted. The Gospel of the Hebrews was in use in
          the orthodox Nazarene Church. The Gospel used by the author of the
          Clementines was in use in the same community. It is therefore
          natural to conclude their substantial identity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though
          substantially the same, and both closely related to the Canonical
          Gospel of St. Matthew, they were not completely identical; for the
          Clementine Gospel diverged from the received text of St. Matthew
          more widely than we are justified in concluding did that of the
          Gospel of the Hebrews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That it was in
          Greek and not in Hebrew is also probable. The converts to
          Christianity mentioned in the Recognitions and Homilies are all
          made from Heathenism, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg
          197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and speak Greek. It is at Caesarea, Tripolis, Laodicaea, that the
          churches are established which are spoken of in these
          books,—churches filled, not with Jews, but with Gentile converts,
          and therefore requiring a Gospel in Greek.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Clementine
          Gospel was therefore probably a sister compilation to that of the
          Hebrews and of St. Matthew. The Memorabilia of the Apostles had
          circulated in Hebrew in the communities of pure Jews, in Greek in
          those of Gentile proselytes. These Memorabilia were collected into
          one book by the Hebrew Church, by the Nazarene proselytes, and by
          the compiler of the Canonical Gospel of St. Matthew. This will
          explain their similarity and their differences.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From what has
          been said of the Clementines, it will be seen that their value is
          hardly to be over-estimated as a source of information on the
          religious position of the Petrine Church. Hilgenfeld says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“There is scarcely any single writing which
          is of such importance for the history of the earliest stage of
          Christianity, and which has yielded such brilliant disclosures at
          the hands of the most careful critics, with regard to the earliest
          history of the Christian Church, as the writings ascribed to the
          Roman Clement, the Recognitions and the Homilies.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No conclusion
          has been reached in regard to the author of the Clementines. It is
          uncertain whether the Homilies and the Recognitions are from the
          same hand. Unfortunately, the Greek of the Recognitions is lost. We
          have only a Latin translation by Rufinus of Aquileia (d. 410), who
          took liberties with his text, as he informs Bishop Gaudentius, to

          198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          preface. He found that the copies of the book he had differed from
          one another in some particulars. Portions which he could not
          understand he omitted. There is reason to suspect that he altered
          such quotations as he found in it from the Gospel used by the
          author, and brought them, perhaps unconsciously, into closer
          conformity to the received text. In examining the Gospel employed
          by the author of the Clementines, we must therefore trust chiefly
          to those texts quoted in the Homilies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Various opinions
          exist as to the date of the Clementines. They have been attributed
          to the first, second, third and fourth centuries. If we were to
          base our arguments on the work as it stands, the date to be
          assigned to it is the first half of the third century. A passage
          from the Recognitions is quoted by Origen in his Commentary on
          Genesis, written in A.D. 231; and mention is made in the work of
          the extension of the Roman franchise to all nations under the
          dominion of Rome, an event which took place in the reign of
          Caracalla (A.D. 211). The Recognitions also contain an extract from
          the work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Fato</span></span>, ascribed to Bardesanes,
          but which was really written by one of his scholars. But it has
          been thought, not without great probability, that this passage did
          not originally belong to the Recognitions, but was thrust into the
          text about the middle of the third century.<a id="noteref_303"
          name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have already
          pointed out the fact that the Church in the Clementines is never
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian;”</span> that the word is
          never employed. It belonged to the community established by Paul,
          and with it the Church of Peter had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> no sympathy. To believe in the mission of
          Christ is, in the Clementine Homilies, to become a Jew. The convert
          from Gentiledom by passing into the Church passes under the Law,
          becomes, as we are told, a Jew. But the convert is made subject not
          to the Law as corrupted by the traditions of the elders, but to the
          original Law as re-proclaimed by Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author of
          the Recognitions twice makes St. Peter say that the only difference
          existing between him and the Jews is in the manner in which they
          view Christ. To the apostles he is the Messiah come in humility, to
          come again in glory. But the Jews deny that the Messiah was to have
          two manifestations, and therefore reject Christ.<a id="noteref_304"
          name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although we
          cannot rely on the exact words of the quotations from the Gospel in
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Recognitions,”</span> there are
          references to the history of our Lord which give indications of
          narratives contained in the Gospel used by the pseudo-Clement,
          therefore by the Ebionite Christians whose views he represents. We
          will go through all such passages in the order in which they occur
          in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Recognitions.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          allusion to a text parallel to one in the Canonical Gospels is
          this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not only did they not believe, but
          they added blasphemy to unbelief, saying he was a gluttonous man
          and slave of his belly, and that he was influenced by a
          demon.”</span><a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href=
          "#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> The
          parallel passage is in St. Matthew xi. 18, 19. It is curious to
          notice that in the Recognitions the order is inverted. In St.
          Matthew, <span class="tei tei-q">“they say, He hath a devil....
          They say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber;”</span> and
          that the term <span class="tei tei-q">“wine-bibber”</span> is
          changed into <span class="tei tei-q">“slave of his belly.”</span>
          Probably therefore in this instance the author of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Clementines borrowed from a different
          text from St. Matthew.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the very next
          chapter the Recognitions approaches St. Matthew closer than the
          lost Gospel. For in the account of the crucifixion it is said that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the veil of the Temple was rent,”</span>
          whereas the Gospel of the Hebrews stated that the lintel of the
          Temple had fallen. But here I suspect we have the hand of Rufinus
          the translator. We can understand how, finding in the text an
          inaccuracy of quotation, as he supposed, he altered it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next passage
          relates to the resurrection. <span class="tei tei-q">“For some of
          them, watching the place with all care, when they could not prevent
          his rising again, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">said that he was a magician</span></span>;
          others pretended that he was stolen away.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a> The
          Canonical Gospels say nothing about this difference of opinion
          among the Jews, but St. Matthew states that it was commonly
          reported among them that his disciples had stolen his body away.
          Not a word about any suspicion that he had exercised witchcraft, a
          charge which we know from Celsus was brought against Christ
          later.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next passage
          is especially curious. It relates to the unction of Christ.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He was the Son of God, and the beginning
          of all things; he became man; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">him God anointed with oil that was taken from
          the wood of the Tree of Life</span></span>; and from this anointing
          he is called Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307"
          href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> Then
          St. Peter goes on to argue: <span class="tei tei-q">“In the present
          life, Aaron, the first high-priest, was anointed with a composition
          of chrism, which was made after the pattern of that spiritual
          ointment of which we have spoken before.... But if any one else was
          anointed with the same ointment, as deriving virtue from it, he
          became either king, or prophet, or priest. If, then, this temporal
          grace, compounded by men, had such efficacy, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">consider</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name=
          "Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
          "font-style: italic">how potent was that ointment extracted by God
          from a branch of the Tree of Life</span></span>, when that which
          was made by men could confer so excellent dignities among
          men.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we have
          trace of an apparent myth relating to the unction of Jesus at his
          baptism. Was there any passage to this effect in the Hebrew Gospel
          translated by St. Jerome? It is hard to believe it. Had there been,
          we might have expected him to allude to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But that there
          was some unction of Christ mentioned in the early Gospels, I think
          is probable. If there were not, how did Jesus, so early, obtain the
          name of Christ, the Anointed One? That name was given to him before
          his divinity was wholly believed in, and when he was regarded only
          as the Messiah—nay, even before the apostles and disciples had
          begun to see in him anything higher than a teacher sent from God, a
          Rabbi founding a new school. It is more natural to suppose that the
          surname of the Anointed One was given to him because of some event
          in his life with which they were acquainted, than because they
          applied to him prophecies at a time when certainly they had no idea
          that such prophecies were spoken of him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If some
          anointing did really accompany the baptism, then one can understand
          the importance attached to the baptism by the Elkesaites and other
          Gnostic sects; and how they had some ground for their doctrine that
          Jesus became the Christ only on his baptism. It is remarkable that,
          according to St. John's Gospel, it is directly after the baptism
          that Andrew tells his brother Simon, <span class="tei tei-q">“We
          have found the Messias, which is ... the Anointed.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> Twice
          in the Acts is Jesus spoken of as the Anointed: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast
          anointed.”</span><a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href=
          "#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> The
          second occasion is remarkable, for it again apparently associates
          the anointing with the baptism. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> St. Peter <span class="tei tei-q">“opened his
          mouth and said ... The word which God sent unto the children of
          Israel ... that word ye know, which was published throughout all
          Judaea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John
          preached; how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
          and with power.”</span><a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href=
          "#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a> I do
          not say that such an anointing did take place, but that it is
          probable it did. When Gnosticism fixed on this anointing as the
          communication to Christ of his divine mission and Messiahship, then
          mention of it was cut out of the Gospels in possession of the
          Church, and consequently the Canonical Gospels are without it to
          this day. But the Christian ceremonial of baptism, which was
          founded on what took place at the baptism of the Lord, maintained
          this unction as part of the sacrament, in the Eastern Church never
          to be dissociated from the actual baptism, but in the Western
          Church to be separated from it and elevated into a separate
          sacrament—Confirmation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if in the
          original Hebrew Gospel there was mention of the anointing of Jesus
          at or after his baptism, as I contend is probable, this mention did
          not include an account of the oil being expressed from the branch
          of the Tree of Life; that is a later addition, in full agreement
          with the fantastic ideas which were gradually permeating and
          colouring Judaic Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          baptism, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus put
          out</span></span>, by the grace of baptism, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that fire which the
          priest kindled for sins</span></span>; for, from the time when he
          appeared, the chrism has ceased, by which the priesthood or the
          prophetic or the kingly office was conferred.”</span><a id=

          was therefore in the Gospel used by the author of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Clementines an account of our Lord,
          after his anointing, entering into the Temple and extinguishing the
          altar fires.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In St. John's
          Gospel, on which we may rely for the chronological sequence of
          events with more confidence than we can on the Synoptical Gospels,
          the casting of the money-changers out of the Temple took place not
          long after the baptism. In St. Matthew's account it took place at
          the close of the ministry, in the week of the Passion. That this
          exhibition of his authority marked the opening of his three years'
          ministry rather than the close is most probable, and then it was,
          no doubt, that he extinguished the fires on the altar, according to
          the Gospel used by the author of the Clementines. Whether this
          incident occurred in the Gospel of the Hebrews it is not possible
          to say.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are told that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“James and John, the sons of Zebedee, had a
          command ... not to enter into their cities (<span class=

          that, and this is more probable, there were concurrent traditional
          accounts of our Lord's saying, and that St. Matthew, St. Luke, and
          the writer of the Gospel used by the pseudo-Clement, made use of
          independent texts in their compilations?</p>

          Rufinus has unconsciously altered the text in translating it by
          making <span class="tei tei-q">“sins”</span> singular instead of
          plural.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          necessary to note the insignificant difference of the word ἅ in the
          Homily and the word τί in the Gospel. But who cannot see that the
          addition of the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“their sins,”</span>
          completely changes the thought of the Saviour? Jesus prays God to
          forgive the Jews the crime they commit in crucifying him, and not
          to pardon all the sins of their lives that they have committed. The
          addition of these two words not merely modify the thought; they
          represent another of an inferior order. They would not have been
          introduced into the text if the author of the Gospel used by the
          pseudo-Clement had had the Gospel of St. Luke before him. These
          words were certainly not derived from St. Luke; they are due
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name=
          "Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to a separate
          recollection or tradition of the sayings of the Saviour on the
          cross. Those sayings we may well believe were cherished in the
          memory of the early disciples. Tradition always modifies, weakens,
          renders commonplace the noblest thoughts and most striking sayings,
          and colours the most original with a tint of triviality.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fragment in
          the Homilies clearly belongs to the same narrative as the fragment
          in Justin's Apology. Both are addressed in the second person
          plural, <span class="tei tei-q">“Except ye be born again;”</span>
          in the Gospel of St. John the first is, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Except a man be born again;”</span> the second,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Except a man be born of water and
          spirit;”</span> both in the third person singular. The form of the
          first answer in Justin differs from that in St. John: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he cannot enter the kingdom,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he cannot see the kingdom.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That these are
          independent accounts I can hardly doubt. The words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
          Holy Ghost,”</span> are an obvious interpolation, perhaps a late
          one, in the text of the Homilies; for Rufinus would hardly have
          omitted to translate this, though he did allow himself to make
          short verbal alterations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
          apparent quotation from St. John in the fifth book of the
          Recognitions: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Every one is made the
          servant of him to whom he yields
          subjection.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_353" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> But
          here again the quotation is very questionable. St. John's version
          of our Lord's saying is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever
          committeth sin is the servant of sin.”</span> St. Paul is much
          nearer: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
          210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye not, that to whom ye yield
          yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;
          whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto
          righteousness?”</span><a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href=
          "#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The quotation in
          the Recognitions is not from St. Paul, for the author expressly
          declares it is a saying of our Lord. St. Paul could not have had
          St. John's Gospel under his eye when he wrote, for that Gospel was
          not composed till long after he wrote the Epistle to the Romans. He
          gives no hint that he is quoting a saying of our Lord traditionally
          known to the Roman Christians. He apparently makes appeal to their
          experience when he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye
          not.”</span> Yet this fragment of an ancient lost Gospel in the
          Clementine Recognitions gives another colour to his words; they may
          be paraphrased, <span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye not that saying of
          Christ, To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
          ye are?”</span> It appears, therefore, that this is an earlier
          recorded reminiscence of our Lord's saying than that of St.
          John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is one,
          and only one, apparent quotation from St. Paul in the Recognitions:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In God's estimation, he is not a Jew who
          is a Jew among men, nor is he a Gentile that is called a Gentile,
          but he who, believing in God, fulfils his law and does his will,
          though he be not circumcised.”</span><a id="noteref_355" name=
          "noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> St.
          Paul's words are: <span class="tei tei-q">“He is not a Jew which is
          one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the
          flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and circumcision is
          that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the
          letter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
          doubt a resemblance between these passages. But it is probable that
          the resemblance is due solely to community of thought in the minds
          of both <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
          211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          writers. It would be extraordinary if this were a quotation, for
          the author of the Recognitions nowhere quotes from any Epistle, not
          even from those of St. Peter; and that he, an Ebionite, should
          quote St. Paul, whose Epistles the Ebionites rejected, is scarcely
          credible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Recognitions
          mention the temptation: <span class="tei tei-q">“The prince of
          wickedness ... presumed that he should be worshipped by him by whom
          he knew that he was to be destroyed. Therefore our Lord, confirming
          the worship of one God, answered him, It is written, Thou shalt
          worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. And he,
          terrified by this answer, and fearing lest the true religion of the
          one and true God should be restored, hastened straightway to send
          forth into this world false prophets and false apostles and false
          teachers, who should speak, indeed, in the name of Christ, but
          should accomplish the will of the demon.”</span><a id="noteref_356"
          name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> Here
          we have Christ indicated as the one who was to restore that true
          worship of God which Moses had instituted, but which the Ebionites,
          with their Essene ancestors, asserted had been defaced and
          corrupted by false traditions. And in opposition to this, the devil
          sends out false apostles, false teachers, to undo this work,
          calling themselves, however, apostles of Christ. There can be
          little doubt who is meant. The reference is to St. Paul, Silas, and
          those who accepted his views, in opposition to those of St. James
          and St. Peter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Homily xii.
          is a citation which seems to indicate the use of the third
          Canonical Gospel. At first sight it appears to be a combination of
          a passage of St. Matthew and a parallel passage of St. Luke. It is
          preceded in the Homily by a phrase not found in the Canonical
          Gospels, but which is given, together with what follows,

          with a grievous disease. And she came to our Lord, crying out and

          Gentile, and remaining in the same course of life, he would not

          one text supposed to be taken from St. Mark's Gospel, four from St.
          Luke's, and two from St. John's. But I do not think we are
          justified in concluding that these quotations are taken from the
          three last-named Canonical Gospels. That they are not taken

          be almost certain, for that Gospel was not received by the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The resemblance
          is striking. Nevertheless I do not think we have a right to
          conclude that this passage in the Clementine Homilies is
          necessarily a citation from St. John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The text is
          quoted in connection with the peculiar Ebionite doctrine of seasons
          and days already alluded to. When our Lord says that he heals the
          sins of ignorance, he is made in the Clementine Gospel to assert
          that the blindness of the man was the result of disregard by his
          parents of the new moons and sabbaths, not wilfully, but through
          ignorance. <span class="tei tei-q">“The afflictions you
          mentioned,”</span> says St. Peter in connection with this
          quotation, <span class="tei tei-q">“are the result of ignorance,
          but assuredly not of wickedness. Give me the man who sins not, and
          I will show you the man who suffers not.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though this
          is the interpretation put on the words of our Lord by the
          Clementine Ebionite, it by no means flows naturally from them; it
          is rather wrung out of them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The words, I
          think, mean that the blindness of the man is symbolical; its
          mystical meaning is ignorance. Our Lord by opening the eyes of the
          blind exhibits himself as the spiritual enlightener of mankind. He
          is come to unclose men's eyes to the true light that he sheds
          abroad in the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In St. John's
          Gospel, after having declared that blindness was not the punishment
          of sin in the man or his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
          217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          parents, our Lord continues, <span class="tei tei-q">“I must work
          the works of Him that sent me, while it is day; the night cometh,
          when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light
          of the world.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Put this last
          declaration in connection with the saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am come to heal the sins of ignorance,”</span> and
          the connection of ideas is at once apparent. The blindness of the
          man is symbolical of the ignorance of the world. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am the light of the world, and I have come to dispel
          the darkness of the ignorance of the world.”</span> And so saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he spat on the ground, and made clay of
          the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the
          clay.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few important
          words in Christ's teaching had escaped the memory of St. John. But
          they had been noted down by some other apostle, and the
          recollections of the latter were embodied in the Gospel in use
          among the Ebionites.</p>

          Peter.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serapion, Bishop
          of Antioch, in 190, on entering his see, learned that there was a
          Gospel attributed to St. Peter read in the sacred services of the
          church of Rhosus, in Cilicia. Taking it for granted, as he says,
          that all in his diocese held the same faith, without perusing this
          Gospel, he sanctioned its use, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“If
          this be the only thing that creates difference among you, let it be
          read.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he was
          speedily made aware that this Gospel was not orthodox in its
          tendency. It favoured the opinions of the Docetae. It was whispered
          that if it had an apostolic parentage, it had heretical sponsors.
          Serapion thereupon borrowed the Gospel, read it, and found it was
          even as had been reported. <span class="tei tei-q">“Peter,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“we receive with the other
          apostles as Christ himself,”</span> but this Gospel was, if not
          apocryphal as to its facts, at all events heretical as to its
          teaching.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon
          Serapion, regretting his precipitation in sanctioning the use of
          the Gospel, wrote a book upon it, <span class="tei tei-q">“in
          refutation of its false assertions.”</span><a id="noteref_374"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This book
          unfortunately has been lost, so that we are not able to learn much
          more about the Gospel. What was its origin? Was it a forgery from
          beginning to end? This is by no means probable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
          St. Mark, as we have seen, was due to St. Peter, and by some went
          by the name of the Gospel <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
          220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of St. Peter. It was a Gospel greatly affected by the Docetae and
          Elkesaites. <span class="tei tei-q">“Those who distinguish Jesus
          from Christ, and who say that Christ was impassible, but that Jesus
          endured the sufferings of his passion, prefer the Gospel of
          Mark,”</span> says Irenaeus.<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375"
          href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was likely
          that they should prefer it, for it began at the baptism, and this
          event it stated, or was thought to state, was the beginning of the
          Gospel; to Docetic minds an admission, an assertion rather, that
          all that preceded was of no importance; Jesus was but a man as are
          other men, till the plenitude of the Spirit descended on him. The
          early history might be matter of curiosity, but not of
          edification.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That matter is
          evil is a doctrine which in the East has proved the fertile mother
          of heresies. Those infected with this idea—and it is an idea, like
          Predestinarianism, which, when once accepted and assimilated,
          pervades the whole tissue of belief and determines its form and
          complexion—could not acknowledge frankly and with conviction the
          dogma of the Incarnation. That God should have part with matter,
          was as opposed to their notions as a concord of light with
          darkness. Carried by the current setting strongly that way, they
          found themselves landed in Christianity. They set to work at once
          to mould Christianity in accordance with their theory of the
          inherent evil in matter. Christ, an emanation from the Pleroma, the
          highest, purest wave that swept from the inexhaustible fountain of
          Deity, might overshadow, but could not coalesce with, the human
          Jesus. The nativity and the death of our Lord were repugnant to
          their consciences. They evaded these facts by considering that he
          was born and died as man, but that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> bright overshadowing cloud of the Divinity,
          of the Christ, reposed on him for a brief period only; it descended
          at the baptism, it withdrew before the passion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the
          party—they were scarcely yet a sect—who used the Gospel of St.
          Peter. Was this Gospel a corrupted edition of St. Mark? Probably
          not. We have not much ground on which to base an opinion, but there
          is just sufficient to make it likely that such was not the
          case.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the Docetae,
          the nativity of our Lord was purely indifferent; it was not in
          their Gospel; that it was miraculous they would not allow. To admit
          that Christ was the Son of God when born of Mary, was to abandon
          their peculiar tenets. It was immaterial to them whether Jesus had
          brothers and sisters, or whether James and Jude were only his
          cousins. The Canonical Gospels speak of the brothers and sisters of
          Christ, and we are not told that they were not the children of
          Mary.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href=

          the Memorabilia were committed to writing, there was no necessity
          for doing so. The relationship was known to every one. Catholics,
          maintaining the perpetual virginity of the mother of Jesus,
          asserted that they were children of Joseph by a former wife, or
          cousins. The Gospel of St. Peter declared them to be the children
          of Joseph by an earlier marriage. Origen says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There are persons who assure us that the brothers of
          Jesus were the sons whom Joseph had by his first wife, before he
          married Mary. They base their opinion on either the Gospel entitled
          the Gospel of Peter, or on the Book of James (the
          Protevangelium).”</span><a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377"

          would not have been intruded into the Gospel by the Docetae, as it
          favoured no doctrine of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg
          222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          theirs. It must therefore have existed in the Gospel before it came
          into their hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We know how St.
          Mark's Gospel was formed. After the death of his master, the
          evangelist compiled all the fragmentary <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Recollections”</span> of St. Peter concerning our
          Lord. But these recollections had before this circulated throughout
          the Church. We have evidence of this in the incorporation of some
          of them into the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. Others,
          besides St. Mark, may have strung these fragments together. One
          such tissue would be the Gospel of St. Peter. It did not, perhaps,
          contain as many articles as that of St. Mark, but it was less
          select. Like those of St. Matthew and St. Luke, on the thread were
          probably strung memorabilia of other apostles and disciples, but
          also, perhaps, some of questionable authority.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This collection
          was in use at Rhosus. It may have been in use there since apostolic
          days; perhaps it was compiled by some president of the church
          there. But it had not been suffered to remain without
          interpolations which gave it a Docetic character.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its statement of
          the relationship borne by the <span class="tei tei-q">“brothers and
          sisters”</span> to our Lord is most valuable, as it is wholly
          unprejudiced and of great antiquity. The Gospel, held in reverence
          as sacred in the second century at Rhosus, was probably brought
          thither when that church was founded, not perhaps in a consecutive
          history, but in paragraphs. The church was a daughter of the church
          of Antioch, and therefore probably founded by a disciple of St.
          Peter.</p>

          existed in the second half of the second century; and as it was
          then in use and regarded as canonical by certain Christian sects,
          it must have been older. We shall not be far out if we place its
          composition at the beginning of the second century.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To form an idea
          of its tendency, we must have recourse to two different sources,
          the second Epistle of Clemens Romanus, the author of which seems to
          have made use of no other Gospel than that of the Egyptians, and
          Clement of Alexandria, who quotes three passages from it, and
          refutes the theories certain heretics of his time derived from
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
          Epistle of St. Clement of Rome is a Judaizing work, as
          Schneckenburg has proved incontestably.<a id="noteref_379" name=
          "noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a> It is
          sufficient to remark that the Chiliast belief which transpires in
          more than one place, the analogy of ideas and of expressions which
          it bears to the Clementine Homilies, and finally the selection of
          Clement of Rome, a personage as dear to the Ebionites as the
          apostles James and Peter, to place the composition under his
          venerated name, are as many indications of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Judaeo-Christian character and origin of
          this apocryphal work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel cited
          by the author of this Epistle, except in two or three phrases which
          are not found in any of our Canonical Gospels, recalls that of St.
          Matthew. Nevertheless, it is certain that the quotations are from
          the Gospel of the Egyptians, for one of the passages cited in this
          Epistle is also quoted by Clement of Alexandria, who tells us
          whence it comes—from the Egyptian Gospel. We may conclude from this
          that the Gospel of the Egyptians presented great analogy to our
          first Canonical Gospel, without being identical with it, and
          consequently that it was related closely to the Gospel of the
          Hebrews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the second
          Epistle of Clement of Rome determines for us the family to which
          this Gospel belonged, the passages we shall extract from the
          Stromata of Clement of Alexandria will determine its order. There
          are three of these passages, and very curious ones they are.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first is
          cited by both Clement of Rome and Clement of Alexandria, by one
          more fully than by the other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          kingdom would come, replied, When you shall have trampled under
          foot the garment of shame, when two shall be one, when that which

          with the female shall be neither male nor
          female.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380"

          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The explanation
          of this singular passage by Clement of Rome is, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Two shall be one when we are truthful with each other,
          and when in two bodies there will be but one soul, without
          dissimulation and without disguise. That which is without is the
          body; that which is within is the soul. Just as your body appears
          externally, so should your soul manifest itself by good
          works.”</span> The explanation of the last member of the phrase is
          wanting, as the Epistle has not come down to us entire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this is
          certainly not the real meaning of the passage. Its true
          signification is to be found in the bloodless, passionless
          exaltation at which the ascetic aimed who held all matter to be
          evil, the body to be a clog to the soul, marriage to be abominable,
          meats to be abstained from. It points to that condition as one of
          perfection in which the soul shall forget her union with the body,
          and, sexless and ethereal, shall be supreme.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was in this
          sense that the heretics took it. Julius Cassianus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“chief of the sect of the Docetae,”</span><a id=
          "noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a>
          invoked this text against the union of the sexes. This
          interpretation manifestly embarrassed St. Clement of Alexandria,
          and he endeavours to escape from the difficulty by weakening the
          authority of the text.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He does this by
          pointing out that the saying of our Lord is found only in the
          Gospel of the Egyptians, and not in those four generally received.
          But as Julius Cassianus appealed at the same time to a saying of
          St. Paul, the authenticity of which was not to be contested, the
          Alexandrine doctor did not consider that he could avoid discussing
          the question; and he gives, on his side, an interpretation of the
          saying of Jesus in the Apocryphal Gospel, and of that of St. Paul,
          associated with it by Julius Cassianus. The words of St. Paul
          quoted by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg
          226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          heretic were those in Galatians (iii. 28): <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free,
          male or female.”</span> Cassianus paid no regard to the general
          sense of the passage, which is, that the privileges of the gospel
          are common to all of every degree and nation and sex, but fastening
          on the words <span class="tei tei-q">“neither male nor
          female,”</span> contended that this was a prohibition of marriage.
          St. Clement pays every whit as little regard to the plain sense of
          the passage, and gives the whole an absurd mystic signification, as
          far removed from the thought of the apostle as the explanation of
          Julius Cassianus. <span class="tei tei-q">“By male,”</span> says
          he, <span class="tei tei-q">“understand anger, folly. By female
          understand lust; and when these are carried out, the result is
          penitence and shame.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          thought that the words <span class="tei tei-q">“when two shall be
          one”</span> recall the philosophic doctrine of the Pythagoreans on
          the subject of numbers and the dualism which was upheld by many of
          the Gnostics. St. Mark, according to Irenaeus, taught that
          everything had sprung out of the monad and dyad.<a id="noteref_382"
          name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a> But
          it is not so. The teaching was not philosophic, but practical. It
          may be thus paraphrased: <span class="tei tei-q">“The kingdom of
          heaven shall have come when the soul shall have so broken with the
          passions and feelings of the body, that it will no longer be
          sensible of shame. The body will be lost in the soul, so that the
          two shall become one; the body which is without shall be like the
          soul within, and the male with the female shall be insensible to
          passion.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a
          doctrine which infected whole bodies of men later: the independence
          of the soul from the body led to wild asceticism and frantic
          sensuality running hand in hand. Holding this doctrine, the
          Fraticelli in the thirteenth century flung themselves into the most
          fiery temptations, placed themselves in the most perilous
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name=
          "Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> positions; if they
          fell, it mattered not, the soul was not stained by the deeds of the
          body; if they remained unmoved, the body was indeed mastered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the two had become one.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The garment of
          shame is to be trampled under foot. Julius Cassianus explains this
          singular expression. It is the apron of skins wherewith our first
          parents were clothed, when they blushed at their nakedness. They
          blushed because they were in sin; when men and women shall cease to
          blush at their nudity, then they have attained to the spiritual
          condition of unfallen man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see in embryo
          the Adamites of the Middle Ages, the Anabaptists of the
          Reformation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the garment
          of skin has a deeper signification. Philo taught<a id="noteref_383"
          name="noteref_383" href="#note_383"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a> that
          it symbolized the human body that clothed the nakedness of the
          Spirit. Gnosticism caught at the idea. Unfallen man was pure
          spirit. Man had fallen, and his fall consisted in being clothed in
          flesh. This garment of skin must be trodden under foot, that the
          soul may arise above it, be emancipated from its bonds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
          passage is quite in harmony with the first: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Salome having asked how long men should die,
          the Lord answered and said, As long as you women continue to bear
          children.</span><a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href=
          "#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a>
          <span style="font-style: italic">Then she said, I have done well, I
          have never borne a child. The Lord answered, Eat of every herb, but
          not of that containing in itself
          bitterness.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_385" name=
          "noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cassian appealed
          to this text also in proof that marriage <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> was forbidden. But Clement of Alexandria
          refused to understand it in this sense. He is perhaps right when he
          argues that the first answer of our Lord means, that as long as
          there are men born, so long men will die. But the meaning of the
          next answer entirely escapes him. When our Lord says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Eat of every herb save that in which is
          bitterness,”</span> he means, says Clement, that marriage and
          continence are left to our choice, and that there is no command one
          way or the other; man may eat of every tree, the tree of celibacy,
          or the tree of marriage, only he must abstain from the tree of
          evil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this is not
          what was meant. Under a figurative expression, the writer of this
          passage conveyed a warning against marriage. Death is the fruit of
          birth, birth is the fruit of marriage. Abstain from eating of the
          tree of marriage, and death will be destroyed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this is the
          meaning of this remarkable saying is proved conclusively by another
          extract from the Gospel of the Egyptians, also made by Clement of
          Alexandria; it is put in the mouth of our Lord. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">I am come to destroy the works of the woman;
          of the woman, that is, of concupiscence, whose works are generation
          and death.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_386" name=
          "noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> This
          quotation bears on the face of it marks of having been touched and
          explained by a later hand. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of the
          woman,—that is, concupiscence, whose works are generation and
          death,”</span> are a gloss added by an Encratite, which was adopted
          into the text received among the Egyptian Docetae. The words,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am come to destroy the works of the
          woman,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Eve, may have been spoken
          by our Lord. By Eve came sin and death into the world, and these
          works Christ did indeed come to destroy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the gloss,
          as is obvious, alters the meaning of the saying. The woman is no
          longer Eve, but womankind <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg
          229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in general; and by womankind, that is, by concupiscence, generation
          and death exist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clement of
          Alexandria was incapable of seizing the plain meaning of these
          words. He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord has not deceived
          us, for he has indeed destroyed the works of concupiscence, viz.
          love of money, of strife, glory, of women ... now the birth of
          these vices is the death of the soul, for we die indeed by our
          sins.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must look to
          Philo for the key. The woman, Eve, means, as he says, the sense;
          Adam, the intellectual spirit. The union of soul and body is the
          degradation of the soul, the fertile parent of corruption and
          death.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href=
          "#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> Out
          of Philo's doctrine grew a Manichaeanism in the Christian community
          before Manes was born.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work of
          Jesus was taught to be the emancipation of the soul, the rational
          spirit, Νοῦς, from the restraints of the body, its restoration to
          its primitive condition. Death would cease when the marriage was
          dissolved that held the spirit fettered in the prison-house of
          flesh.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Philonian
          philosophy remained vigorous at Alexandria in the circle of
          enlightened Jews. It struck deep root, and blossomed in the
          Christian Church.</p>

          to the Hebrews, an Epistle clearly addressed to the Alexandrine
          Jews, prepared their minds to fuse Philonism with Christianity. We
          see its influence in the Gospel of St. John. That evangelist
          adopted Philo's doctrine of the Logos; the author of the Gospel of
          the Egyptians, that of the bondage of the spirit in
          matter.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conceptions
          contained in the three passages which Clement of Alexandria has
          preserved are closely united. They all are referable to a certain
          theosophy, the exposition of which is to be found in the writings
          of Philo, and which may be in vain sought elsewhere at that period.
          Not only are there to be found here the theosophic system of the
          celebrated Alexandrine Jew, but also, what is a still clearer index
          of the source whence the Egyptian Gospel drew its mystic
          asceticism, we find the quaint expressions and forms of speech
          which belonged to Philo, and to none but him. No one but Philo had
          thought to find in the first chapters of Genesis the history of the
          fall of the soul into the world of sense, and to make of Eve, of
          the woman, the symbol of the human body, and starting from this to
          explain how the soul could return to its primitive condition,
          purely spiritual, by shaking off the sensible to which in its
          present state it is attached. When we shall have trampled under
          foot our tunics of skins wherewith we have been covered since the
          fall, this garment, given to us because we were ashamed of our
          nakedness,—when the body shall have become like the soul,—when the
          union of the soul with the body, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of
          the male and the female, shall exist no more,—when the woman, that
          is the body, shall be no more productive, shall no more produce
          generation and death,—when its works are destroyed, then we shall
          not die any more; we shall be as we were before our fall, pure
          spirits; and this will be the kingdom of the Lord. And to prepare
          for this transformation, what is to be done? Eat of every herb,
          nourish ourselves on the fruit of every tree of paradise,—that is,
          cultivate the soul, and not occupy it with anything but that which
          will make it live; but abstain from the herb of bitterness,—the
          tree of the knowledge <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg
          231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of good and evil, that is,—reject all that can weave closer the
          links binding the soul to the body, retain it in its prison, its
          grave.<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is easy to
          see how Philonian ideas continued to exert their influence in
          Egypt, when absorbed into Christianity. It was these ideas which
          peopled the deserts of Nitria and Scete with myriads of monks
          wrestling with their bodies, those prison-houses of their souls,
          struggling to die to the world of matter, that their ethereal souls
          might shake themselves free. Their spirits were like moths in a
          web, bound by silken threads; the spirit would be choked by these
          fetters, unless it could snap them and sail away.</p>

          the Lord, Εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Κυρίου, was the banner under which the

          that of the Gospel of the Hebrews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
          the Lord was used by Marcion, and apparently before him by
          Cerdo.<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In opposition to
          Ebionitism, with its narrow restraints and its low Christology,
          stood an exclusive Hellenism. Ebionitism saw in Jesus the Son of
          David, come to re-edit the Law, to provide it with new sanction,
          after he had winnowed the chaff from the wheat in it. Marcionism
          looked to the Atonement, the salvation wrought by Christ for all
          mankind, to the revelation of the truth, the knowledge (γνῶσις) of
          the mysteries of the Godhead made plain to men, through God the
          good and merciful, who sent His Son to bring men out of ignorance
          into <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name=
          "Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> light, out of the
          bondage of the Law into the freedom of the Gospel.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel, in
          the eyes of Marcion and the extreme followers of St. Paul,
          represented free grace, overflowing goodness, complete
          reconciliation with God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But such
          goodness stood contrasted with the stern justice of the Creator, as
          revealed in the books of the Old Testament; infinite, unconditioned
          forgiveness was incompatible with the idea of God as a Lawgiver and
          a Judge. The restraint of the Law and the freedom of the Gospel
          could no more emanate from the same source than sweet water and
          bitter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore the
          advanced Pauline party were led on to regard the God who is
          revealed in the Old Testament as a different God from the God
          revealed by Christ. Cerdo first, and Marcion after him, represented
          the God of this world, the Demiurge, to be the author of evil; but
          the author of evil only in so far as that his nature being
          incomplete, his work was incomplete also. He created the world, but
          the world, partaking in his imperfection, contains evil mixed with
          good. He created the angel-world, and part of it, through defect in
          the divinity of their first cause, fell from heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The germs of
          this doctrine, it was pretended, were to be found in St. Paul's
          Epistles. In the second to the Corinthians, after speaking of the
          Jews as blinded to the revelation of the Gospel by the veil which
          is on their faces, the apostle says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
          lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name=
          "Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> image of God, should
          shine unto them.”</span><a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391"
          href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> St.
          Paul had no intention of representing the God of the Jews who
          veiled their eyes as opposed to Christ; but it is easy to see how
          readily those who followed his doctrine of antagonism between the
          Law and the Gospel would be led to suppose that he did identify the
          God of the Law with the principle of obstructiveness and of
          evil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So also St.
          Paul's teaching that sin was produced by the Law, that it had no
          positive existence, but was called into being by the imposition of
          the Commandments, lent itself with readiness to Marcion's system.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Law entered, that the offence might
          abound.”</span><a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“I had not known sin, but by the Law: for I
          had not known lust, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not
          covet.”</span><a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Law,
          imposed by the God of the Jews, is then the source of sin. It is
          imposed, not on the spirit, but on the flesh. In opposition to it
          stands the revelation of Jesus Christ, which repeals the Law of the
          Jews. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Law of the spirit of life in
          Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and
          death.”</span><a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Before faith came, we were kept under the

          Wherefore the Law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find in St.
          Paul's writings all the elements of Marcion's doctrine, but not
          compacted into a system, because St. Paul never had worked out such
          a theory, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg
          238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and would have shrunk from the conclusions which might be drawn
          from his words, used in the heat of argument, for the purpose of
          opposing an error, not of establishing a dogmatic theory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole world
          lay, according to Marcion, under the dispensation of the Demiurge,
          and therefore under a mixed government of good and evil. To the
          Jewish nation this Demiurge revealed himself. His revelation was
          stern, uncompromising, imperfect. Then the highest God, the God of
          love and mercy, who stood opposed to the inferior God, the Creator,
          the God of justice and severity, sent Jesus Christ for the
          salvation of all (ad salutem omnium gentium) to overthrow and
          destroy (arguere, redarguere, ἐλέγχειν, καταλεύειν) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Law and the Prophets,”</span> the revelation of
          the world-God, the God of the Jews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The highest God,
          whose realm and law were spiritual, had been an unknown God (deus
          ignotus) till Christ came to reveal Him. The God of this world and
          of the Jews had a carnal realm, and a law which was also carnal.
          They formed an antithesis, and true Christianity consisted in
          emancipation from the carnal law. The created world under the
          Demiurge was bad; matter was evil; spirit alone was pure. Thus the
          chain unrolled, and lapsed into Manichaeism. Cerdo and Marcion
          stood in the same relation to Manes that Paul stood in to them.
          Manichaeism was not yet developed; it was developing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gnosticism, with
          easy impartiality, affected Ebionitism on one side and Marcionism
          on the other, intensifying their opposition. It was like oxygen
          combining here to form an alkali, there to generate an acid.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The God of love,
          according to Marcion, does not punish. His dealings with man are,
          all benevolence, communication of free grace, bestowal of ready
          forgiveness. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg
          239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          For if sin be merely violation of the law of the God of this world,
          it is indifferent to the highest God, who is above the Demiurge,
          and regards not his vexatious restrictions on the liberty of
          man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet Marcion was
          not charged by his warmest antagonists with immorality. They could
          not deny that the Marcionites entirely differed from other Pauline
          Antinomians in their moral conduct—that, for example, in their
          abhorrence of heathen games and pastimes they came fully up to the
          standard of the most rigid Catholic Christians. While many of the
          disciples of St. Paul, who held that an accommodation with
          prevailing errors was allowable, that no importance was to be
          attached to externals, found no difficulty in evading the
          obligation to become martyrs, the Marcionites readily, fearlessly,
          underwent the interrogations of the judges and the tortures of the
          executioner.<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcion, there
          is no doubt, regarded St. Paul as the only genuine apostle, the
          only one who remained true to his high calling. He taught that
          Christ, after revealing himself in his divine power to the God of
          this world, and confounding him unto submission, manifested himself
          to St. Paul,<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href=

          commissioned him to preach the gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rejected all
          the Scriptures now accounted canonical, except the Epistles of St.
          Paul, which formed with him an <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Apostolicon,”</span> in which they were arranged in
          the following order:—The Epistle to the Galatians, the First and
          Second to the Corinthians, the Epistles to the Romans, the
          Thessalonians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon, and to the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          Epistles of St. Paul, he made use of an <span class="tei tei-pb"

          evangelical record cited and used by Paul himself. The other
          Canonical Gospels he rejected as corrupted by Judaizers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Gospel bore

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tertullian
          assures us that Marcion had cut out of St. Luke's Gospel whatever
          opposed his own doctrines, and retained only what was in favour of
          them.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href=

          statement, as we shall see presently, was not strictly true.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Epiphanius is
          more precise. He goes most carefully over the Gospel used by
          Marcion, and discusses every text which, he says, was modified by
          the heretic.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The charge of
          mutilating the Canonical Gospels was brought by the orthodox
          Fathers against both the Ebionites on one side, and the Marcionites
          and Valentinians on the other, because the Gospels they used did
          not exactly agree with those employed by the middle party in the
          Church which ultimately prevailed. But the extreme parties on their
          side made the same charge against the Catholics.<a id="noteref_404"
          name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class=

          not necessary to believe these charges in every case.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the
          Gospels<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href=
          "#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a> were
          compiled as in the manner I have contended they were, such
          discrepancies must have occurred. Every Church had its own
          collection of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg
          241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Logia”</span> and of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Practhenta”</span> of Christ. The more voluminous of
          these collections, those better strung together, thrust the
          earlier, less complete, collections into the back-ground. And these
          collections were continually being augmented by the acquisition of
          fresh material; and this new material was squeezed into the
          existing text, often without much consideration for the chain of
          story or teaching which it broke and dislocated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcion was too
          conscientious and earnest a man wilfully to corrupt a Gospel. He
          probably brought with him to Rome the Gospel in use at Sinope in
          Pontus, of which city, according to one account, his father was
          bishop. The Church in Sinope had for its first bishop, Philologus,
          the friend of St. Paul, if we may trust the pseudo-Hippolytus and
          Dorotheus. It is probable that the Church of Sinope, when founded,
          was furnished by St. Paul with a collection of the records of
          Christ's life and teaching such as he supplied to other
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic”</span> churches. And this
          collection was, no doubt, made by his constant companion Luke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the Gospel
          of Marcion may be Luke's original Gospel. But there is every reason
          to believe that Luke's Gospel went through considerable alteration,
          probably passed through a second edition with considerable
          additions to it made by the evangelist's own hand, before it became
          what it now is, the Canonical Luke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He may have
          found reason to alter the arrangement of certain incidents; to
          insert whole paragraphs which had come to him since he had composed
          his first rough sketch; to change certain expressions where he
          found a difference in accounts of the same sayings, or to combine
          several.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
          first edition was published in the full heat of the Pauline
          controversy. Its strong Paulinianism lies on the surface. But
          afterwards, when this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
          242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          excitement had passed away, and the popular misconception of
          Pauline sola-fidianism had become a general offence to morals and
          religion, then Luke came under the influence of St. John, and
          tempered his Gospel by adding to it incidents Paul did not care to
          have inserted in the Gospel he wished his converts to receive, or
          the accuracy of which, as disagreeing with his own views, he was
          disposed to question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of this I shall
          have more to say presently. It is necessary, in the first place,
          briefly to show that Marcion's Gospel contained a different
          arrangement of the narrative from the Canonical Luke, and was
          without many passages which it is not possible to believe he
          wilfully excluded. For instance, in Marcion's Gospel: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And as he entered into a certain village, there met
          him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: and they lifted
          up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. And
          when he saw them, he said unto them, Go, show yourselves unto the
          priests. And it came to pass, that as they went, they were
          cleansed. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
          prophet; and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian.
          And one of them, when he saw that he was healed,”</span> &amp;c.
          Here the order is Luke xvii. 12, 13, 14, iv. 27, xvii. 15. Such a
          disturbance of the text in the Canonical Gospel could serve no
          purpose, would not support any peculiar view of Marcion, and cannot
          therefore have been a wilful alteration. And in the first chapter
          of Marcion's Gospel this is the sequence of verses whose parallels
          in St. Luke are: iii. 1, iv. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
          16, 20 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the order
          of events is different in the two Gospels. Christ goes first to
          Capernaum in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of the
          Lord,”</span> and afterwards to Nazareth, an inversion of the order
          as given in the Gospel of St. Luke. Again, in <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this instance, no purpose was served by
          this transposition. It is unaccountable on the theory that Marcion
          corrupted the Gospel of Luke; but if we suppose that Luke revised
          the arrangement of his Gospel after its first publication, the
          explanation is simple enough.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what is far
          more conclusive of the originality of Marcion's Gospel is, that his
          Gospel was without several passages which occur in St. Luke, and
          which do apparently favour his views. Such are Luke xi. 51, xiii.
          30 and 34, xx. 9-16. These contain strong denunciations of the Jews
          by Jesus Christ, and a positive declaration that they had fallen
          from their place as the elect people. Marcion insisted on the
          abrogation of the Old Covenant; it was a fundamental point in his
          system; he would consequently have found in these passages powerful
          arguments in favour of his thesis. He certainly would not have
          excluded them from his Gospel, had he tampered with the text, as
          Irenaeus and Tertullian declare.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet Marcion
          would not scruple to use the knife upon a Gospel that came into his
          hands, if he found in it passages that wholly upset his doctrine of
          the Demiurge and of asceticism. For when the Church was full of
          Gospels, and none were as yet settled authoritatively as canonical,
          private opinion might, unrebuked, choose one Gospel and reject the
          others, or subject any Gospel to critical supervision. The manner
          in which the Gospels were composed laid them open to criticism. Any
          Church might hesitate to accept a saying of our Lord, and
          incorporate it with the Gospel with which it was acquainted, till
          satisfied that the saying was a genuine, apostolic tradition. And
          how was a Church to be satisfied? By internal evidence of
          genuineness, when the apostles themselves had passed away.
          Consequently, each Church was obliged to exert its critical faculty
          in the composition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg
          244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of its Gospel. And that the churches did exert their judgment
          freely is evidenced by the mass of apocryphal matter which remains,
          the dross after the refining, piled up in the Gospels of Nicodemus,
          of the Infancy of Thomas, and of Joseph the Carpenter. All of which
          was deliberately rejected as resting on no apostolic authority, as
          not found in any Church to be read at the sacred mysteries, but as
          mere folk-tales buzzed about, nowhere producing credentials of
          authenticity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcion,
          following St. Paul, declared that the Judaizing Church had
          <span class="tei tei-q">“corrupted the word of God,”</span><a id=
          "noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a>
          meaning such <span class="tei tei-q">“logia”</span> as,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not come to destroy the Law or the
          Prophets.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Till heaven and earth
          pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law,
          till all is fulfilled.”</span><a id="noteref_407" name=
          "noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> These
          texts would naturally find no place in the original Pauline Gospels
          used by the Churches he had founded. In St. Luke's Gospel,
          accordingly, the Law and the Prophets are said to have been until
          John, and since then the Gospel, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          kingdom of God.”</span><a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href=
          "#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> But
          the following verse in St. Luke's Gospel is, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one
          tittle of the Law to fail”</span>—a contradiction of the
          immediately preceding verse, which declares that the Law has ceased
          with the proclamation of the Gospel. This verse, therefore, cannot
          have existed in its present form in the original Gospel of St.
          Luke, and must have been modified when a reconciliation had been
          effected between Petrine and Pauline Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not to be
          wondered at, therefore, that the verse should read differently in
          Marcion's Gospel, which contains the uncorrupted original passage,
          and runs thus <span class="tei tei-q">“It is easier for heaven and
          earth to pass, than for one <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> tittle of my words to fail;”</span> or
          perhaps, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is easier for heaven and earth
          to pass, than one tittle of the words of the Lord to fail;”</span>
          for in this instance we have not the exact words.<a id=
          "noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though
          Marcion certainly endured the presence of texts in his Gospel which
          militated against his system, he may have cut out other passages.
          Passages, or words only, which he thought had crept into the text
          without authority. This can scarcely be denied when the texts are
          examined which are wanting in his Gospel. No strong conservative
          attachment to any particular Gospels had grown up in the Church as
          yet; no texts had been authoritatively sanctioned. As late as the
          end of the second century (A.D. 190), the Church of Rhossus was
          using its own Gospel attributed to Peter, till Serapion, bishop of
          Antioch, thinking that it contained Docetic errors, probably
          because of omissions, suppressed it,<a id="noteref_410" name=
          "noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> and
          substituted for it, in all probability, one of the more generally
          approved Gospels.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Church of
          Rhossus was neither heretical nor schismatical; it formed part of
          the Catholic Church, and, no objection was raised against its use
          of a Gospel of its own, till it was suggested that this Gospel
          contained errors of doctrine. No question was raised whether it was
          an authentic Gospel by Peter or not; the standard by which it was
          measured was the traditional faith of the Church. It did not agree
          with this standard, and was therefore displaced. St. Epiphanius and
          St. Jerome assert, probably unjustifiably, that the orthodox did
          not hesitate to amend their Gospels, if they thought there were
          passages in them objectionable or doubtful. Thus <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they altered the passage in which Jesus
          is said to have wept over Jerusalem (Luke xix. 41). St. Epiphanius
          frankly tells us so. <span class="tei tei-q">“The orthodox,”</span>
          says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“have eliminated these words,
          urged to it by fear, and not feeling either their purpose or
          force.”</span><a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href=
          "#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> But
          it is more likely that the weeping of Jesus over Jerusalem was
          inserted by Luke in his Gospel at the time of reconciliation under
          St. John, so as to make the Pauline Gospel exhibit Jesus moved with
          sympathy for the holy city, the head-quarters of the Law. The
          passage is not in Marcion's Gospel; and though it is possible he
          may have removed it, it is also possible that he did not find it in
          the Pauline Gospel of the Church at Sinope.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Jerome says
          that Luke xxii. 43, 44, were also eliminated from some copies of
          the Canonical Gospel. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Greeks have
          taken the liberty of extracting from their texts these two verses,
          for the same reason that they removed the passage in which it is
          said he wept.... This can only come from superstitious persons, who
          think that Jesus Christ could not have become as weak as is
          represented.”</span><a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href=
          "#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a> St.
          Hilary says that these verses were not found in many Greek texts,
          or in some Latin ones.<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href=
          "#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But here, also,
          the assertion of St. Jerome and St. Hilary cannot be taken as a
          statement of fact, but rather as a conclusion drawn by them from
          the fact that all copies of the Gospel of St. Luke did not contain
          these two verses. They are wanting in the Gospel of our Lord, and
          may be an addition made to the Gospel of St. Luke, after it had
          been first circulated. There is reason to suppose that after St.
          Luke had written his Gospel, additional matter may have been
          provided him, and that he published a second, and enlarged, edition
          of his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
          247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Gospel. Thus some Churches would be in possession of the first
          edition, and others of the second, and Jerome and Epiphanius, not
          knowing this, would conclude that those in possession of the first
          had tampered with their text.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
          Marcion has been preserved to us almost in its entirety. Tertullian
          regarded Marcionism as the most dangerous heresy of his day. He
          wrote against it, and carefully went through the Marcionite Gospel
          to show that it maintained the Catholic faith, though it differed
          somewhat from the Gospel acknowledged by Tertullian, and that
          therefore Marcion's doctrine was untenable.<a id="noteref_414"
          name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> He
          does not charge Marcion with having interpolated or curtailed a
          Canonical Gospel, for Marcion was ready to retort the charge
          against the Gospel used by Tertullian.<a id="noteref_415" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          probable that Tertullian passed over any passage in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of the Lord”</span> which could by
          any means be made to serve against Marcion's system. This is the
          more probable, because Tertullian twists the texts to serve his
          purpose which in the smallest degree lend themselves to being so
          treated.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=

          has gone over much the same ground as Tertullian, but in a
          different manner. He attempts to show how wickedly Marcion had
          corrupted the Word of God, and how ineffectual his attempt had
          been, inasmuch as passages in his corrupted Gospel served to
          destroy his system.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these two
          purposes he went through the whole of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Gospel of the Lord,”</span> and accompanied it with a
          string of notes, indicating all the alterations and omissions
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name=
          "Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he found in it. Each
          text from Marcion's Gospel, or Scholion, is accompanied by a
          refutation. Epiphanius is very particular. He professes to disclose
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the fraud of Marcion from beginning to
          end.”</span> And the pains he took to do this thoroughly appear
          from the minute differences between the Gospels which he
          notices.<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href=
          "#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> At
          the same time, he does not extract long passages entire from the
          Gospel, but indicates their subject, where they agreed exactly with
          the received text. It is possible, therefore, that other slight
          differences may have existed which escaped his eye, but the
          differences can only have been slight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
          table gives the contents of the Gospel of Marcion. It contains
          nothing that is not found in St. Luke's Gospel. But some of the
          passages do not agree exactly with the parallel passages in the
          Canonical Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shall now make

          or which, in it, differ from the Canonical Gospel of St. Luke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. It was not
          attributed to St. Luke. It was Τὸ Εὐαγγέλιον, not κατὰ Λουκᾶν.
          Tertullian explicitly says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Marcion
          inscribes no name on his Gospel,”</span><a id="noteref_450" name=
          "noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a> and
          in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Dialogue on the Right Faith”</span>
          it is asserted that he protested his Gospel was <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em>
          Gospel, the only one; and that the multiplicity of Gospels used by
          Catholics, and their discrepancies, were a proof that none of these
          other Gospels were genuine. He even went so far as to assert that
          his Gospel was written by Christ,<a id="noteref_451" name=
          "noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a> and
          when closely pressed on this point, and asked whether Christ wrote
          the account of his own passion and resurrection, he said it was so,
          but afterwards hesitated, and asserted that it was probably added
          by St. Paul.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This shows
          plainly enough that Marcion had received the Gospel, probably from
          the Church of Sinope, where it was the only one known, and that he
          had heard nothing about St. Luke as its author; indeed, knew
          nothing of its origin. He treated it with the utmost veneration,
          and in his veneration for it attributed its authorship to the Lord
          himself; supposing the words of St. Paul, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Gospel of Christ,”</span><a id="noteref_452" name=
          "noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a> to
          mean that Jesus Christ was the actual author of the book.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcion, it may
          be remarked, would have had no objection to acknowledging St. Luke
          as the compiler of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
          257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Gospel, as that evangelist was a devoted follower of St. Paul.
          If he did not do so, it was because at Sinope the Gospel read in
          the Church was not known by his name.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Marcion's
          Gospel was without the Preface, Luke i. 1-4.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Preface is
          certainly by St. Luke, but was added, we may conjecture, after the
          final revision of his Gospel, when he issued the second edition.
          Its absence from Marcion's Gospel shows that it did not accompany
          the first edition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The narrative
          of the nativity, Luke i. ii., is not in Marcion's Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          supposed by critics that he omitted this narrative purposely,
          because his Christ was descended from the highest God, had no part
          with the world of the Demiurge, and had therefore no earthly
          mother.<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href=
          "#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a> But
          if so, why did Marcion suffer the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to
          see thee”</span> (Luke viii. 20), to remain in his Gospel?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And it does not
          appear that Marcion denied the incarnation <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          toto</span></span>, and went to the full extreme of Docetic
          doctrine. On the contrary, he taught that Christ deceived the God
          of this World, by coming into it as a man. The Demiurge trusted he
          would be his Messiah, to confirm the Law for ever. But when he saw
          that Christ was destroying the Law, he inflicted on him death. And
          this was only possible, because Christ was, through his human
          nature, subject to his power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a less
          violent supposition that in the Church of Sinope the Gospel was,
          like that of St. Mark, without a narrative of the nativity and
          childhood of Jesus. It is probable, moreover, that the first two
          chapters of St. Luke's Gospel were added at a later period. The
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name=
          "Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> account of the
          nativity and childhood is taken from the mouths of the blessed
          Virgin Mary, of eye-witnesses, or contemporaries. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her
          heart,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“His mother kept all
          these sayings in her heart.”</span><a id="noteref_456" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> This
          is our guaranty that the story is true. Mary kept them in memory,
          and the evangelist appeals to her memory for them. So with regard
          to the account of the nativity of the Baptist, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“All they that heard these things laid them up in their
          hearts.”</span><a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is not
          probable that St. Luke or St. Paul were brought in contact with the
          Virgin and the people about Hebron, relatives of the Baptist. Their
          lives were spent in Asia Minor. But St. John, we know, became the
          guardian of the blessed Virgin after the death of Christ.<a id=
          "noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class=

          ecclesiastical tradition declares that she accompanied him to
          Ephesus. But be that as it may, St. John almost certainly would
          have tenderly and reverently collected the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“memorabilia”</span> of the blessed Mother concerning
          her Divine Son's birth and infancy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. John had the
          organizing and disciplining of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Asiatic”</span> churches founded by St. Paul after the
          removal of the Apostle of the Gentiles. When he came to Ephesus,
          and went through the Churches of Asia Minor, he found a Gospel
          compiled by St. Luke in general use. To this he added such
          particulars as were expedient to complete it, amongst others the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“recollections”</span> of St. Mary, and the
          relatives of the Baptist. It is most probable that he gave them to
          St. Luke to work into his narrative, and thus to form a second
          edition of his Gospel.<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href=

          excitement can hardly be doubted. We shall see instances as we
          proceed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The section
          relating to the Baptist (Luke iii. 2-19), with which the most
          ancient Judaizing Gospels opened, was absent from that of
          Marcion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John belonged to
          the Old Covenant; he could not therefore be regarded as revealing
          the Gospel of the unknown God. This is thought by Baur, Hilgenfeld
          and Volckmar, to be the reason of the omission. But the explanation
          is strained. I think it probable, as stated above, that St. Luke
          when with St. Paul had not got the narrative of those who had heard
          and seen the birth of the Baptist and his preaching beyond Jordan.
          Had Marcion, moreover, objected to the Baptist as belonging to the
          Old Covenant, he would not have suffered the presence in his Gospel
          of the passage, Luke vii. 24-28, containing the high commendation
          of John, <span class="tei tei-q">“This is he of whom it is written,
          Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare
          the way before thee.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. There is no
          mention in Marcion's Gospel of the baptism of our Lord (Luke iii.
          21, 22). This is given very briefly in St. Luke's Gospel. To the
          Nazarene Church this event was of the utmost importance; it was
          regarded as the beginning of the mission of Jesus, the ratification
          by God of his Messiahship, and therefore the Gospels of Mark and of
          the Hebrews opened with it. But the significance was not so deeply
          felt by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
          260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Gentile converts, and therefore the circumstance is despatched in a
          few words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. The genealogy
          of Joseph is not given (Luke iii. 23-38). This is not to be
          wondered at. It is an evidently late interpolation, clumsily
          foisted into the sacred text, rudely interrupting the
          narrative.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(21):
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now when all the people were baptized, it
          came to pass that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the
          heaven opened, (22) and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape
          like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said,
          Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. (iv. 1): And
          Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was
          led by the Spirit into the wilderness.”</span> Such is the natural
          order. But it is interrupted by the generation of Joseph, the
          supposed father of Jesus, from Adam. This generation does not
          concern Jesus at all, but it came through some Jewish Christians
          into the hands of the Church in Asia Minor, and was forced between
          the joints of the sacred text, to the interruption of the narrative
          and the succession of ideas.<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460"
          href="#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Marcion had it not in the Gospel brought from Pontus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. The narrative
          of the Temptation is not in Marcion's Gospel. It can have been no
          omission of his, for it would have tallied admirably with his
          doctrine. He held that the God of this world believed Christ at
          first to be the Messiah, but finally was undeceived. In the
          narrative of the Temptation the devil offers Christ all the
          kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. He takes the position
          which in Marcion's scheme was occupied by the Demiurge. Had he
          possessed the record of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg
          261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Temptation, it would have mightily strengthened his
          position.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of our Lord”</span> opens with the
          words, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the fifteenth year of Tiberius
          Caesar, Pontius Pilate ruling in Judaea (ἡγεμονεύοντος in place of
          ἐπιτροπεύοντος, an unimportant difference), Jesus came down to
          Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and straightway on the Sabbath days,
          going into the synagogue, he taught”</span> (εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὴν
          συναγωγὴν ἐδίδασκε in place of καὶ διδάσκων αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς
          σάββασιν), again an unimportant variation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">9. The words
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus of Nazareth”</span><a id=

          in Marcion's Gospel simply <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus.”</span>
          This may have been done by Marcion on purpose. But there is no
          evidence that it was omitted in xxiv. 19.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">10. The order of
          events, as given in Luke iv., is changed. Jesus, in Marcion's
          Gospel, goes first to Capernaum, and then to Nazareth, reversing
          the order in St. Luke.</p><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By placing the
          subject-matter of the two narratives side by side, and numbering
          that of St. Luke consecutively, and giving the corresponding
          paragraphs, with their numbers as in Luke's order, arranged in the
          Marcionite succession, the reader is able at once to see the
          difference. No doctrinal question was touched by this
          transposition. The only explanation of it which is satisfactory is
          that each Gospel contained fragments which were pieced together
          differently. One block consisted of paragraphs 2-8; another, of
          paragraphs 9-14; another 15. Besides these blocks, there were
          chips, splinters, the paragraphs 1, 13, 15. Marcion's Gospel was
          without 1 and 4.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Par. 2, verse
          15: <span class="tei tei-q">“He taught in their synagogues, being
          glorified of all,”</span> was common to both Gospels. In Marcion's,
          most appropriately, it came after Christ has performed miracles;
          less judiciously in Luke's does it come before the performance of
          miracles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Par. 13:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“And the fame of him went out into every
          place of the country round about.”</span> St. Luke put this
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name=
          "Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> after Christ had
          taught in Nazareth and Capernaum; in Marcion's Gospel it was before
          he had been to Nazareth, but immediately after the healing of
          Simon's wife's mother. It ought probably to occupy the place
          assigned it in Marcion's text. The fame of Christ spreads. They in
          Nazareth hear of it, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“What we have
          heard done in Capernaum, do also here.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Par. 15:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now when the sun was setting, all they
          that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto
          him,”</span> &amp;c., as in St. Luke iv. 40, 41. This Marcion's
          Gospel has immediately after the healing of the sick wife of Simon,
          as though the rumour of the miracle attracted all who had sick
          relations to bring them to Christ. No doubt the paragraph should
          rightly stand in connection with this miracle of healing the
          fevered woman.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there are
          omissions supposed to have been made purposely by Marcion. In verse
          16 of St. Luke's Gospel, c. iv.: <span class="tei tei-q">“He came
          to Nazareth, where he had been brought up,”</span> in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of the Lord”</span> ran,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He came to Nazareth”</span> only. But it
          is not improbable that <span class="tei tei-q">“where he had been
          brought up”</span> was a gloss which crept into the text after the
          addition of the narrative of the early years of Christ had been
          added to the Canonical Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the reading
          from the prophet Esaias, and the exposition of the prophecy (Luke
          iv. 17-21) was omitted, there can be small question, by Marcion,
          because it mutilated against his views touching the prophets as
          ministers, not of the God of Christ, but of the God of this
          world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Luke iv. 23:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Do also here in thy country,”</span>
          changed into, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do also here.”</span> It is
          possible that <span class="tei tei-q">“in thy country”</span> may
          be a gloss which has crept into a later text of St. Luke's Gospel,
          or was inserted by Luke in his second edition.</p>

          29-35 are wanting in Marcion's Gospel. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> That verses 29-32 should have been purposely
          excluded, it is impossible to suppose, as they favoured Marcion's
          tenets. It has been argued that the rest of the verses, 33-35, were
          cut out by Marcion because in verse 34 it is said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Son of Man is come eating and drinking; and ye
          say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber.”</span> But the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of the Lord”</span> contained Luke
          v. 33: <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do the disciples of John fast
          often, and make long prayers, and likewise the disciples of the
          Pharisees; but thine eat and drink;”</span> and the example of
          Christ going to the feast prepared by Levi is retained (v. 29).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">12. Luke viii.
          19: <span class="tei tei-q">“Then came to him his mother and his
          brethren,”</span> &amp;c., omitted; but the next verse,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“And it was told him by certain which said,
          Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see
          thee.”</span> This cannot be admitted as a mutilation by Marcion.
          Had he cut out verse 19, he would also have removed verse 20.
          Rather is verse 19 an amplification of the original text. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“saying”</span> of Jesus was known in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Asiatic”</span> churches; and when Luke
          wove it into the text of his Gospel, he introduced it with the
          words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then came to him his mother and his
          brethren, and could not come at him for the press,”</span> words
          not necessary, but deducible from the preserved text, and useful as
          introducing it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">13. Luke x. 21:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In that hour he rejoiced in the spirit,
          and said, I praise and thank thee, Lord of heaven, that those
          things which are hidden from the wise and prudent thou hast
          revealed to babes.”</span> The version in Luke's Gospel may have
          been tampered with by Marcion, lest God should appear harsh in
          hiding <span class="tei tei-q">“those things from the wise and
          prudent.”</span> But it is more likely that Marcion's text is the
          correct one. Why should Christ thank God that he has hidden the
          truth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name=
          "Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> from the wise and
          prudent? The reading in Marcion's Gospel is not only a better one,
          but it also appears to be an independent one. He has, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I praise and thank thee.”</span> The received text
          differs in different codices; in some, Jesus rejoices <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in the Spirit;”</span> in others, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in the Holy Spirit.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">14. Luke x. 22:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“All things are delivered to me of my
          Father, and no man hath known the Father save the Son, nor the Son
          save the Father, and he to whom the Son hath revealed him.”</span>
          No doctrinal purpose was effected by the change. It is therefore
          probable that the Sinope Gospel ran as in Marcion's text.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">15. Luke x. 25:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Doing what shall I obtain life?”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal”</span> being omitted, it is
          thought, lest Jesus should seem to teach that eternal life was to
          be obtained by fulfilling the Law.<a id="noteref_462" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> But
          Marcion did not alter the same question when asked by the ruler, in
          Luke xviii. 18; for then Christ, after he has referred him to the
          Law, goes on to impose on him a higher law—that of love. But
          <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal”</span> may be an addition to
          Luke's text in the second edition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">16. The first
          petition in the Lord's Prayer differs in Marcion's Gospel from that
          in St. Luke. Marcion has, <span class="tei tei-q">“Father! may thy
          Holy Spirit come to us, Thy kingdom come,”</span> &amp;c., instead
          of, <span class="tei tei-q">“Father! (which art in heaven—not in
          the most ancient copies of St. Luke) Hallowed be thy name,”</span>
          &amp;c. No purpose was served by this difference; and we must not
          attribute to Marcion in this instance wilful alteration of the
          sacred text. It is apparent that several versions of the Lord's
          Prayer existed in the first age of the Church, and that this was
          the form in which it was accepted and used in Pontus, perhaps
          throughout Asia Minor.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg
          266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the Lord's
          Prayer in St. Luke's Gospel stood originally as in Marcion's Gospel
          is made almost certain by verse 13. After giving the form of
          prayer, xi. 2-4, Christ instructs his disciples on the readiness of
          God to answer prayer. <span class="tei tei-q">“And,”</span> he
          continues, <span class="tei tei-q">“if ye then, being evil, know
          how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more shall your
          heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?”</span>
          How ready will He be to give that which you have learned to ask in
          the first petition of the prayer I have just taught you! The
          petition was altered in the received text later, to accommodate it
          to the form given in St. Matthew's Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">17. Luke xi. 29:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“There shall no sign be given.”</span> What
          follows in St. Luke's Gospel, <span class="tei tei-q">“but the sign
          of the prophet Jonas,”</span> and verses 30-32, were not found in
          Marcion's Gospel. Perhaps all this was inserted in the second
          edition of St. Luke's Gospel. But also perhaps the allusions to the
          Ninevites and the Queen of the South were omitted, because of the
          condemnation pronounced on the generation which received not Christ
          through them; and Jesus was not the manifestation of the God of
          judgment, but of the God of mercy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">18. So also
          <span class="tei tei-q">“judgment”</span> was turned into
          <span class="tei tei-q">“calling,”</span> in verse 42; and also the
          verses 49-51, in which the blood of the prophets is said to be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“required of this generation.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">19. Luke xii.
          38: <span class="tei tei-q">“The evening watch”</span> is perhaps
          an earlier reading than the received one: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If he shall come in the second watch, or come in the
          third watch;”</span> which has the appearance of an expansion of
          the simpler text.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evening
          watch was the first watch. The Christians in the first age thought
          that our Lord would come again immediately. But as he did not
          return again in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg
          267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          glory in the first watch, they altered the text to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the second watch or the third watch.”</span>
          Consequently Marcion's text is the original unaltered one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">20. Luke xii. 6,
          7: <span class="tei tei-q">“Are not five sparrows sold for two
          farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even
          the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore;
          ye are of more value than many sparrows.”</span> Perhaps Marcion
          omitted this because he did not hold that the Supreme God concerned
          Himself with the fate of men's bodies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But more
          probably the passage did not occur in the original Pauline Gospel,
          but was grafted into it afterwards when St. Matthew's Gospel came
          into the hands of the Asiatic Christians, when it was transferred
          from it (x. 29-31) verbatim to Luke's Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">21. Marcion's
          Gospel was without Luke xiii. 1-10.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The absence of
          the account of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with
          their sacrifices, and of those on whom the tower in Siloam fell,
          which occurs in the received text, removes a difficulty. St. Luke
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“There were present at that season
          some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood,”</span> &amp;c.,
          as though it were a circumstance which had just taken place,
          whereas this act of barbarity was committed when Quirinus, not
          Pilate, was governor, twenty-four years before the appearance of
          Jesus. And no tower in Siloam is mentioned in any account of
          Jerusalem. The mention of the Galilaeans in the canonical text has
          the appearance of an anachronism, and probably did not exist in the
          Gospel which Marcion received, and was a late addition to the
          Gospel of Luke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The parable of
          the fig-tree which follows may, however, have been removed by
          Marcion lest the Supreme God should appear as a God of judgment
          against those who produced no fruit, <span class=

          more probable that this parable, which has an anti-Pauline moral,
          was not in the original edition of Luke's Gospel.</p>

          deutero-Luke, clearly disturbs the train of thought. Ye Jews shall
          weep when ye see the δικαίοι, those made righteous through faith,
          by the righteousness which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          thinks that the account of the Judgment by St. Matthew and St. Luke
          is couched in terms coloured by the respective parties to which the
          evangelists belonged, and that the sentences on the lost are
          sharpened to pierce the antagonistic party. Thus, in the Gospel of
          St. Luke, Christ dooms to woe those who are workers of
          unrighteousness, ἐργάται ἀδικίας,<a id="noteref_464" name=

          the Pauline favourite expression to designate those who are cast
          out to weeping and gnashing of teeth, as men who have not received
          the righteousness which is of faith; whereas, in St. Matthew it is
          the workers of anomia, οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν,<a id=

          which Hilgenfeld thinks the Pauline anti-legalists are not
          obscurely hinted at, who are hurled into outer darkness. In St.
          Luke it is curious to notice how the lost are described as Jews:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We have eaten and drunk in thy presence,
          and thou hast taught in our streets;”</span> whereas the elect who
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name=
          "Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“from the east and from the west, and from
          the north and from the south,”</span> that is to say, are
          Gentiles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Marcion's
          text we have therefore the ἀδικαίοι shut and cast out, and the
          δικαίοι sitting overthroned in the kingdom of God. It can scarcely
          be doubted that this is the correct reading, and that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,”</span> was substituted for
          δικαίοι at a later period with a conciliatory purpose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rest of the
          chapter, 31-35, is not to be found in Marcion's Gospel. The first
          who are to be last, and the last first, not obscurely means that
          the Gentiles shall precede the Jews. This was in the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Gospel of the Lord,”</span> which was, however,
          without the warning given to Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“Get
          thee out, and depart hence; for Herod will kill thee,”</span> and
          the lamentation of the Saviour over the holy city, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the
          prophets,”</span> &amp;c. Why Marcion should omit this is not
          clear. It was probably not in the Gospel of Sinope.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">23. Luke xiv.
          7-11. The same may be said of the parable put forth to those bidden
          to a feast, when Christ marked how they chose out the chief rooms.
          It has been supposed by critics that Marcion omitted it, lest Jesus
          should seem to sanction feasting; but this reason is far-fetched,
          and it must be remembered that he did retain Luke v. 29 and 33.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">24. Luke xv.
          11-32. The parable of the Prodigal Son is omitted. That it is left
          out, as is suggested by some critics, because the elder son
          signifies mystically the Jewish Church, and the prodigal son
          represents the Heathen world, is to transfer such allegorical
          interpretations back to an earlier age than we are justified in
          doing. Marcion was not bound to admit such an interpretation of the
          parable, if received in his day. Marcion, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> moreover, opposed allegorizing the sayings of
          Scripture, and insisted on their literal interpretation. Neander
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The other Gnostics united with their
          theosophical idealism a mystical, allegorizing interpretation of
          the Scriptures. Marcion, simple in heart, was decidedly opposed to
          this artificial method of interpretation. He was a zealous advocate
          of the literal interpretation which prevailed among the antagonists
          of Gnosticism.”</span><a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href=

          therefore most improbable that a popular interpretation of this
          parable, if such an interpretation existed at that time, should
          have induced Marcion to omit the parable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">25. Luke xvi.
          12: <span class="tei tei-q">“If ye have not been faithful in that
          which is another man's, who will give you that which is
          mine?”</span> Surely a reading far preferable to that in the
          Canonical Gospel, <span class="tei tei-q">“who will give you that
          which is your own?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">26. Luke, xvi.
          17: <span class="tei tei-q">“One tittle of my words shall not

          the Law shall not fall.”</span> As has been already remarked, the
          reading in St. Luke is evidently corrupt, altered deliberately by
          the party of conciliation. Marcion's is the genuine text.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">27. Luke xvii.
          9, 10. The saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are unprofitable
          servants; we have done that which was our duty to do,”</span> was
          perhaps omitted by Marcion, lest the Gospel should seem to sanction
          the idea that any obligation whatever rested on the believer. The
          received text is thoroughly Pauline, inculcating the worthlessness
          of man's righteousness. Hahn and Ritschl argue that the whole of
          the parable, 7-10, was not in Marcion's Gospel; and this is
          probable, though St. Epiphanius only says that Marcion cut out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We are unprofitable servants; we have done
          that which was our duty to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          whole Parable has such a Pauline ring, that it would probably have
          been accepted in its entirety by Marcion, if his Gospel had
          contained it; and the parable is divested of its point and meaning

          18: <span class="tei tei-q">“There are not found returning to give
          glory to God. And there were many lepers in the time of Eliseus the
          prophet in Israel; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the
          Syrian.”</span> In the Gospel of the Lord, this passage concerning
          the lepers in the time of Eliseus occurs <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em>;
          once in chap. i. v. 15, as already given, and again here. It has
          been preserved in St. Luke's Gospel in only one place, in that
          corresponding with Marcion i. 15, viz. Luke iv. 27.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear that
          this was a fragmentary saying of our Lord drifting about, which the
          compiler of the Sinope Gospel inserted in two places where it
          thought it would fit in with other passages. When St. Luke's Gospel
          was revised, it was found that this passage occurred twice, and
          that it was without appropriateness in chap. xvii. after verse 18,
          and was therefore cut out. But in Marcion's Gospel it remained, a
          monument of the manner in which the Gospels were originally
          constructed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">29. Luke xviii.

          the text, not a deliberate alteration.</p>

          Gospel Jesus is not hailed as <span class="tei tei-q">“King of the
          Jews”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of David.”</span> Had
          this been the case, these two titles, we may conclude, would have
          been eliminated from the narrative; but we see no reason why the
          whole account should be swept away. It probably did not exist in
          the original Gospel Marcion obtained in Pontus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Did Marcion cut
          out the narrative of the expulsion of the buyers and sellers from
          the Temple? I think not. St. John, in his Gospel, gives that event
          in his second chapter as occurring, not at the close of the
          ministry of Christ, but at its opening.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. John is the
          only evangelist who can be safely relied upon for giving the
          chronological order of events. St. Matthew, as has been already
          shown, did not write the acts of our Lord, but his sayings only;
          and St. Mark was no eye-witness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Pauline Gospel
          would not contain the account of the purifying of the Temple, and
          the saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“My house is the house of
          prayer.”</span> But when St. Matthew's Gospel, or St. Mark's, found
          its way into Asia Minor, this passage was extracted from one of
          them, and interpolated in the Lucan text, in the same place where
          it occurred in those Gospels—at the end of the ministry, and
          therefore in the wrong place.</p>

          9-18. The parable of the vineyard and the husbandmen. This Marcion
          probably omitted because it made the Lord of the vineyard, who sent
          forth the prophets, the same as the Lord who sent his son. The lord
          of the vineyard to Marcion was the Demiurge, but the Supreme Lord
          sent Christ.</p>

          should appear to concern himself about the vile bodies of men,
          under the dominion of the God of this world; but more probably this
          verse did not exist in the original text. The awkwardness of its
          position has led many critics to reject it as an
          interpolation,<a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468" href=

          the fact of Marcion's Gospel being without it goes far to prove
          that the original Luke Gospel was without it.</p>

          21, 22. The warning given by our Lord to his disciples to flee from
          Jerusalem when they see it encompassed with armies. Verse 21 was
          omitted no doubt because of the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“These be the days of vengeance, that all things which
          are written may be fulfilled.”</span> This jarred with Marcion's
          conception of the Supreme God as one of mercy, and of Jesus as
          proclaiming blessings and forgiveness, in place of the vengeance
          and justice of the World-God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">36. Luke xxii.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">37. Luke xxii.
          28-30. The promise that the apostles should eat and drink in
          Christ's kingdom and judge the twelve tribes, was omitted by
          Marcion, as inconsistent with his views of the spiritual nature of
          the heavenly kingdom; and that judgment should be committed by the
          God of free forgiveness to the apostles, was in his sight
          impossible. Why Luke xxiii. 43, 47-49, were not in Marcion's Gospel
          does not appear; they can hardly have been omitted purposely.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">38. Luke xxiii.
          2. In Marcion's Gospel it ran: <span class="tei tei-q">“And they
          began to accuse him, saying, We found this one perverting the
          nation, and destroying the Law and the Prophets, and forbidding to
          give tribute to Caesar, and leading away the women and
          children.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          possible that Marcion should have forced the words <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“destroying the Law and the Prophets”</span> into the
          text, for these are the accusations of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">false</span></em>
          witnesses. And this is precisely what Marcion taught that Christ
          had come to do. Both this accusation and that other, that he drew
          away after him the women and children from their homes and domestic
          duties and responsibilities, most probably did exist in the
          original text. It is not improbable that they were both made to
          disappear from the authorized text later, when the conciliatory
          movement began.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">39. Luke xxiv.
          43. In Marcion's Gospel, either the whole of the verse,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily, I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou
          be with me in Paradise,”</span> was omitted, or more probably only
          the words <span class="tei tei-q">“in Paradise.”</span> Marcion
          would not have purposely cut out such an instance of free
          acceptance of one who had all his life transgressed the Law, but he
          may have cancelled the words <span class="tei tei-q">“in
          Paradise.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">40. Luke xxiv.
          25 stood in Marcion's Gospel, <span class="tei tei-q">“O fools, and
          in heart slow to believe all that he spake unto you;”</span> and 27
          and 45, which relate that Jesus explained to the two disciples out
          of Moses and the Prophets how he must suffer, and that he opened
          their understanding to understand the Scriptures, were both
          absent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">41. Luke xxiv.
          46. Instead of Christ appealing to the Prophets, Marcion made him
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“These are the words which I spake
          unto you, while I was yet with you, that thus it behoved Christ to
          suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day.”</span> This was
          possibly Marcion's doing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other
          differences between Marcion's Gospel and the Canonical Gospel of
          St. Luke are so small, that the reader need not be troubled with
          them here. For a fuller and more particular account of Marcion's
          Gospel <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          from the list of differences between the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Gospel of our Lord”</span> and the Gospel of St. Luke,
          that all the apparent omissions cannot be attributed to Marcion.
          The Gospel he had he regarded with supreme awe; it was because his
          Gospel was so ancient, so hallowed by use through many years, that
          it was invested by him with sovereign authority, and that he
          regarded the other Gospels as apocryphal, or at best only
          deutero-canonical.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is by no
          means certain that even where his Gospel has been apparently
          tampered with to suit his views, his hands made the alterations in
          it. What amplifications St. Luke's Gospel passed through when it
          underwent revision for a second edition, we cannot tell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
          our Lord, if not the original Luke Gospel—and this is probable—was
          the basis of Luke's compilation. But that it was Luke's first
          edition of his Gospel, drawn up when St. Paul was actively engaged
          in founding Asiatic Churches, is the view I am disposed to take of
          it. As soon as a Church was founded, the need of a Gospel was felt.
          To satisfy this want, Paul employed Luke to collect memorials of
          the Lord's life, and weave them together into an historical
          narrative.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
          our Lord contains nothing which is not found in that of St. Luke.
          The arrangement is so similar, that we are forced to the conclusion
          that it was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg
          276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          either used by St. Luke, or that it was his original composition.
          If he used it, then his right to the title of author of the third
          Canonical Gospel falls to the ground, as what he added was of small
          amount. Who then composed the Gospel? We know of no one to whom
          tradition even at that early age attributed it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Luke was the
          associate of St. Paul; ecclesiastical tradition attributes to him a
          Gospel. That of <span class="tei tei-q">“Our Lord”</span> closely
          resembles the Canonical Luke's Gospel, and bears evidence of being
          earlier in composition, whilst that which is canonical bears
          evidence of later manipulation. All these facts point to Marcion's
          Gospel as the original St. Luke—not, however, quite as it came to
          Marcion, but edited by the heretic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the first
          edition of Luke bore a stronger Pauline impress than the second is
          also probable. The Canonical Luke has the Pauline stamp on it
          still, but beside it is the Johannite seal. More fully than any
          other Gospel does it bring out the tenderness of Christ towards
          sinners, a feature which has ever made it exceeding precious to
          those who have been captives and blind and bruised, and to whom
          that Gospel proclaims Christ as their deliverer, enlightener and
          healer.<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          necessary here to point out the finger-mark of Paul in this Gospel;
          it has been often and well done by others. It is an established
          fact, scarcely admitting dispute, that to him it owes its colour,
          and that it reflects his teaching.<a id="noteref_471" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And it was this
          Gospel, in its primitive form, before it had passed under the hands
          of St. John, or had been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg

          recast by its author, that I think we may be satisfied Marcion
          possessed. That he made a few erasures is probable, I may almost
          say certain; but that he ruthlessly carved it to suit his purpose
          cannot be established.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the value of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valentine, by
          birth an Egyptian, probably of Jewish descent, it may be presumed
          received his education at Alexandria. From this city he travelled
          to Rome (circ. A.D. 140); in both places he preached the Catholic
          faith, and then retired to Cyprus.<a id="noteref_472" name=

          miserable bigotry which refused to see in a heretic any motives but
          those which are evil, declared that in disgust at not obtaining a
          bishopric which he coveted, and to which a confessor was preferred,
          Valentine lapsed into heresy. We need no such explanation of the
          cause of his secession from orthodoxy. He was a man of an active
          mind and ardent zeal. Christian doctrine was then a system of
          facts; theology was as yet unborn. What philosophic truths lay at
          the foundation of Christian belief was unsuspected. Valentine could
          not thus rest. He strove to break through the hard facts to the
          principles on which they reposed. He was a pioneer in Christian
          theology.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And for his
          venturous essay he was well qualified. His studies at Alexandria
          had brought him in contact with Philonism and with Platonism. He
          obtained at Cyprus an acquaintance with the doctrines of Basilides.
          His mind caught fire, his ideas expanded. The Gnostic seemed to him
          to open gleams of light through the facts of the faith he had
          hitherto professed with dull, unintelligent submission; and he
          placed himself under the inspiration and instruction of
          Basilides.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
          279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he did not
          follow him blindly. The speculations of the Gnostic kindled a train
          of ideas which were peculiarly Valentine's own.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The age was not
          one to listen patiently to his theorizing. Men were called on to
          bear testimony by their lives to facts. They could endure the rack,
          the scourge, the thumbscrew, the iron rake, for facts, not for
          ideas. That Jesus had lived and died and mounted to heaven, was
          enough for their simple minds. They cared nothing, they made no
          effort to understand, what were the causes of evil, what its
          relation to matter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Consequently
          Valentine met with cold indifference, then with hot abhorrence. He
          was excommunicated. Separation embittered him. His respect for
          orthodoxy was gone; its hold upon him was lost; and he allowed
          himself to drift in the wide sea of theosophic speculation wherever
          his ideas carried him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valentine taught
          that in the Godhead, exerting creative power were manifest two
          motions—a positive, the evolving, creative, life-giving element;
          and the negative, which determined, shaped and localized the
          creative force. From the positive force came life, from the
          negative the direction life takes in its manifestation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world is the
          revelation of the divine ideas, gradually unfolding themselves, and
          Christ and redemption are the perfection and end of creation.
          Through creation the idea goes forth from God; through Christ the
          idea perfected returns to the bosom of God. Redemption is the
          recoil wave of creation, the echo of the fiat returning to the
          Creator's ear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          manifestation of the ideas of God is in unity; but in opposition to
          unity exists anarchy; in antagonism with creation emerges the
          principle of destruction. The representative of destruction,
          disunion, chaos, is Satan. The work of creation is infinite
          differentiation in perfect <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> harmony. But in the midst of this emerges
          discord, an element of opposition which seeks to ruin the concord
          in the manifestation of the divine ideas. Therefore redemption is
          necessary, and Christ is the medium of redemption, which consists
          in the restoration to harmony and unity of that which by the fraud
          of Satan is thrown into disorder and antagonism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But how comes it
          that in creation there should be a disturbing element? That element
          must issue in some manner from the Creator; it must arise from some
          defect in Him. Therefore, Valentinian concluded, the God who
          created the world and gave source to the being of Satan cannot have
          been the supreme, all-good, perfect God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if
          redemption be the perfecting of man, it must be the work of the
          only perfect God, who thereby counteracts the evil that has sprung
          up through the imperfection of the Demiurge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore Jesus
          Christ is an emanation from the Supreme God, destroying the ill
          effects produced in the world by the faulty nature of the Creator,
          undoing the discord and restoring all to harmony.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus was formed
          by the Demiurge of a wondrously constituted ethereal body, visible
          to the outward sense. This Jesus entered the world through man, as
          a sunbeam enters a chamber through the window. The Demiurge created
          Jesus to redeem the people from the disorganizing, destructive
          effects of Satan, to be their Messiah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Supreme
          God had alone power perfectly to accomplish this work; therefore at
          the baptism of Christ, the Saviour (Soter) descended on him,
          consecrating him to be the perfect Redeemer of mankind, conveying
          to him a mission and power which the Demiurge could not have
          given.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all this we
          see the influence of Marcion's ideas.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We need not
          follow out this fundamental principle of his theosophy into all its
          fantastic formularies. If Valentine was the precursor of Hegel in
          the enunciation of the universal antinomy, he was like Hegel also
          in involving his system in a cloud of incomprehensible terminology,
          in producing bewilderment where he sought simplicity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valentine
          accepted the Old Testament, but only in the same light as he
          regarded the great works of the heathen writers to be deserving of
          regard.<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href=
          "#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> Both
          contained good, noble examples, pure teaching; but in both also was
          the element of discord, contradictory teaching, and bad example.
          Ptolemy, the Valentinian who least sacrificed the moral to the
          theosophic element, scarcely dealt with the Old Testament
          differently from St. Paul. He did not indeed regard the Old
          Testament as the work of the Supreme God; the Mosaic legislation
          seemed to him to be the work of an inferior being, because, as he
          said, it contained too many imperfections to be the revelation of
          the Highest God, and too many excellences to be attributed to an
          evil spirit. But, like the Apostle of the Gentiles, he saw in the
          Mosaic ceremonies only symbols of spiritual truth, and, like him,
          he thought that the symbol was no longer necessary when the idea it
          revealed was manifested in all its clearness. Therefore, when the
          ideas these symbols veiled had reached and illumined men's minds,
          the necessity for them—husks to the idea, letters giving meaning to
          the thought—was at an end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like St. Paul,
          therefore, he treated the Old Testament as a preparation for the
          New one, but as nothing more. We ascertain Ptolemy's views from a
          letter of his to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg
          282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Flora, a Catholic lady whom he desired to convert to
          Valentinianism.<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href=
          "#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this letter
          he laboured to show that the God of this world (the Demiurge) was
          not the Supreme God, and that the Old Testament Scriptures were the
          revelation of the Demiurge, and not of the highest God. To prove
          the first point, Ptolemy appealed to apostolic tradition—no doubt
          to Pauline teaching—which had come down to him, and to the words of
          the Saviour, by which, he admits, all doctrine must be settled. In
          this letter he quotes largely from St. Paul's Epistles, and from
          the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. John.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like Marcion,
          Ptolemy insisted that the Demiurge, the God of this world, was also
          the God who revealed himself in the Old Testament, and that to this
          God belonged justice, wrath and punishment; whereas to the Supreme
          Deity was attributed free forgiveness, absolute goodness. The
          Saviour abolished the Law, therefore he abolished all the system of
          punishment for sin, that the reign of free grace might prevail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          Ptolemy, therefore, retributive justice exercised by the State was
          irreconcilable with the nature of the Supreme God, and the State,
          accordingly, was under the dominion of the Demiurge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the
          revelation of the old Law belonged ordinances of ceremonial and of
          seasons. These also are done away by Christ, who leads from the
          bondage of ceremonial to spiritual religion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          Valentinian of note was Heracleon, who wrote a Commentary on the
          Gospel of St. John, of which considerable fragments have been
          preserved by Origen; and perhaps, also, a Commentary on the Gospel
          of St. Luke. Of the latter, only a single fragment, the exposition
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heracleon was a
          man of deep spiritual piety, and with a clear understanding. He
          held Scripture in profound reverence, and derived his Valentinian
          doctrines from it. So true is the saying:</p>

          interpretation of the narrative of the interview of the Saviour
          with the woman of Samaria will illustrate his method of dealing
          with the sacred text.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heracleon saw in
          the woman of Samaria a type of all spiritual natures attracted by
          that which is heavenly, godlike; and the history represents the
          dealings of the Supreme God through Christ with these spiritual
          natures (πνευματικοί).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For him,
          therefore, the words of the woman have a double meaning: that which
          lies on the surface of the sacred record, with the intent and
          purpose which the woman herself gave to them; and that which lay
          beneath the letter, and which was mystically signified.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The water which our Saviour gives,”</span>
          says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is his spirit and power. His
          gifts and grace are what can never be taken away, never exhausted,
          can never fail to those who have received them. They who have
          received what has been richly bestowed on them from above,
          communicate again of the overflowing fulness which they enjoy to
          the life of others.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the woman
          asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me this water, that I thirst
          not, neither come hither to draw”</span>—hither—that is, to Jacob's
          well, the Mosaic Law from which hitherto she had drunk, and which
          could not quench her thirst, satisfy her aspirations. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“She left her water-pot behind <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class=

          others that she had found the well of eternal life. That is, she
          left the vessel, the capacity for receiving the Law, for she had
          now a spiritual vessel which could hold the spiritual water the
          Saviour gave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          that Valentinianism, like Marcionism, was an exaggerated Paulinism,
          infected with Gnosticism, clearly antinomian. Though the
          Valentinians are not accused of licentiousness, their ethical
          system was plainly immoral, for it completely emancipated the
          Christian from every restraint, and the true Christian was he who
          lived by faith only. He had passed by union with Christ from the
          dominion of the God of this World, a dominion in which were
          punishments for wrong-doing, into the realm of Grace, of sublime
          indifference to right and wrong, to a region in which no acts were
          sinful, no punishments were dealt out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If
          Valentinianism did not degenerate into the frantic licentiousness
          of the earlier Pauline heretics, it was because the doctrine of
          Valentine was an intellectual, theosophical system, quite above the
          comprehension of vulgar minds, and therefore only embraced by
          exalted mystics and cold philosophers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Valentinians
          were not accused of mutilating the Scriptures, but of evaporating
          their significance. <span class="tei tei-q">“Marcion,”</span> says
          Tertullian, <span class="tei tei-q">“knife in hand, has cut the
          Scriptures to pieces, to give support to his system; Valentine has
          the appearance of sparing them, and of trying rather to accommodate
          his errors to them, than of accommodating them to his errors.
          Nevertheless, he has curtailed, interpolated more than did Marcion,
          by taking from the words their force and natural value, to give
          them forced significations.”</span><a id="noteref_476" name=
          "noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pauline
          filiation of the sect can hardly be mistaken. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The relation of Valentine's ideas to
          those of Marcion, and those of Marcion to the doctrines of St.
          Paul, are fundamental. But, moreover, they claimed a filiation more
          obvious than that of ideas—they asserted that they derived their
          doctrines from Theodas, disciple of the Apostle of the
          Gentiles.<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href=
          "#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> The
          great importance they attributed to the Epistles of St. Paul is
          another evidence of their belonging to the anti-judaizing family of
          heretics, if another proof be needed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Valentinians
          possessed a number of apocryphal works. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Their number is infinite,”</span> says Irenaeus.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> But
          this probably applies not to the first Valentinians, but to the
          Valentinian sects, among whom apocryphal works did abound. Certain
          it is, that in all the extracts made from the writings of
          Valentine, Ptolemy and Heracleon, by Origen, Epiphanius,
          Tertullian, &amp;c., though they abound in quotations from St.
          Paul's Epistles and from the Canonical Gospels, there are none from
          any other source.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
          Irenaeus attributes to them possession of a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Gospel of Truth”</span> (Evangelium Veritatis).
          <span class="tei tei-q">“This Scripture,”</span> says he,

          this also, perhaps, Tertullian refers, when he says that the
          Valentinians possessed <span class="tei tei-q">“their own Gospel in
          addition to ours.”</span><a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Epiphanius,
          however, makes no mention of this Gospel; he knew the writings of
          the Valentinians well, and has inserted extracts in his work on
          heresies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The immoral
          tendency of Valentinianism broke out in coarse, flagrant
          licentiousness as soon as the doctrines of the sect had soaked down
          out of the stratum of educated men to the ranks of the
          undisciplined and vulgar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valentinianism
          assumed two forms, broke into two sects,—the Marcosians and the
          Ophites.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark, who lived
          in the latter half of the second century, came probably from
          Palestine, as we may gather from his frequent use of forms from the
          Aramaean liturgy. But he did not bring with him any of the
          Judaizing spirit, none of the grave reverence for the moral law,
          and decency of the Nazarene, Ebionite and kindred sects sprung from
          the ruined Church of the Hebrews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was followed
          by trains of women whom he corrupted, and converted into
          prophetesses. His custom was, in an assembly to extend a chalice to
          a woman saying to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“The grace of God,
          which excels all, and which the mind cannot conceive or explain,
          fill all your inner man, and increase his knowledge in you,

          scene like a Methodist revival followed. The woman was urged to
          speak in prophecy; she hesitated, declared her inability; warm,
          passionate appeals followed closely one on another, couched in
          equivocal language, exciting the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          utterings, and the curtain fell on the rapturous embraces of the
          prophet and his spiritual bride.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark possessed a

          a falsified life of Christ. One of the stories from it he quotes.
          When Jesus was a boy, he was learning letters. The master said,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the root of
          Mark's teaching there seems to have been a sort of Pantheism. He
          taught that all had sprung from a great World-mother, partook of
          her soul and nature; but over against this female principle stood
          the Deity, the male element.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man represents
          the Deity, woman the world element; and it is only through the
          union of the divine and the material that the material can be
          quickened into spiritual life. In accordance with this theory, they
          had a ceremonial of what he called spiritual, but was eminently
          carnal, marriage, which is best left undescribed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not widely
          removed from the Marcosians was the Valentinian sect of the
          Ophites. Valentinianism mingled with the floating superstition, the
          fragments of the wreck of Sabianism, which was to be found among
          the lower classes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ophites
          represented the Demiurge in the same way as did the Valentinians.
          They called the God of this world and of the Jews by the name of
          Jaldaboth. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg
          290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          He was a limited being, imposing restraint on all his creatures; he
          exercised his power by imposing law. As long as his creatures
          obeyed law, they were subject to his dominion. But above Jaldaboth
          in the sublime region without limit reigns the Supreme God. When
          Adam broke the Law of the World-God, he emancipated himself from
          his bondage, he passed out of his realm, he placed himself in
          relation to the Supreme God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world is
          made by Jaldaboth, but in the world is infused a spark of soul,
          emanated from the highest God. This divine soul strives after
          emancipation from the bonds imposed by connection with matter,
          created by the God of this world. This world-soul under the form of
          a serpent urged Eve to emancipate herself from thraldom, and pass
          with Adam, by an act of transgression, into the glorious liberty of
          the sons of the Supreme God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctrine of
          the Ophites with respect to Christ was that of Valentine. Christ
          came to break the last chains of Law by which man was bound, and to
          translate him into the realm of grace where sin does not exist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ophites
          possessed a Gospel, called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of
          Eve.”</span> It contained, no doubt, an account of the Fall from
          their peculiar point of view. St. Epiphanius has preserved two
          passages from it. They are so extraordinary, and throw such a light
          on the doctrines of this Gospel, that I quote them. The first
          is:</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

          beheld a man of great stature, and another who was mutilated. And
          then I heard a voice like unto thunder. And when I drew near, he
          spake with me after this wise: I am thou, and thou art I. And
          wheresoever thou art, there am I, and I am dispersed through all.
          And wheresoever thou willest, there</span> <span class="tei tei-pb"

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a></p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of
          this passage is not doubtful. It expresses the doctrine of absolute
          identity between Christ and the believer, the radiation of divine
          virtue through all souls, destroying their individuality, that all
          may be absorbed into Christ. Individualities emerge out of God, and
          through Christ are drawn back into God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
          St. Paul's ideas is again noticeable. We are not told that the
          perfect man who speaks with a voice of thunder, and who is placed
          in contrast with the mutilated man, is Christ, and that the latter
          is the Demiurge, but we can scarcely doubt it. It is greatly to be
          regretted that we have so little of this curious book
          preserved.<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> The
          second passage, with its signification, had better repose in a
          foot-note, and in Greek. It allows us to understand the expression
          of St. Ephraem, <span class="tei tei-q">“They shamelessly boast of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gospel of
          Perfection was another work regarded as sacred by the Ophites. St.
          Epiphanius says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Some of them
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of the Gnostics) there are
          who vaunt the possession of a certain fictitious, far-fetched poem
          which they call the Gospel of Perfection, whereas it is not a
          Gospel, but the perfection of misery. For the bitterness of death
          is consummated in that production of the devil. Others without
          shame boast their Gospel of Eve.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Epiphanius
          calls this Gospel of Perfection a poem, ποιήμα. But M. Nicolas
          justly observes that the word ποιήμα is used here, not to describe
          the work as a poetical composition, but as a fiction. In a passage
          of Irenaeus,<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href=
          "#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          which only the Latin has been preserved, the Gospel of Judas is
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“confictio,”</span> and it is
          probable that the Greek word rendered by <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“confictio”</span> was ποιήμα.<a id="noteref_491" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baur thinks that

          belonged to the same category as those of Perfection and of Eve,
          and belonged, if not to the Ophites, to an analogous sect, perhaps
          that of the Prodicians. St. Philip passed, in the early ages of
          Christianity, as having been, like St. Paul, an apostle of the
          Gentiles,<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href=

          perhaps as having agreed with his views on the Law and evangelical
          liberty. But tradition had confounded together Philip the apostle
          and Philip the deacon of Caesarea, who, after having been a member
          of the Hellenist Church at Jerusalem, and having been driven thence
          after the martyrdom of Stephen, was the first to carry the Gospel
          beyond the family of Israel, and to convert the heathen to
          Christ.<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          altogether easy to catch the meaning of this singular passage, but
          it apparently has this signification. The soul trammelled with the
          chains of matter, created by the Archon, the Creator of the world,
          has to emancipate itself from all material concerns. Each thought,
          interest, passion, excited by anything in the world, is a child
          borne by the soul to Archon, to which the soul has contributed
          animation, the world, form. The great work of life is the
          disengagement of the soul from all concern in the affairs of the
          world, in the requirements of the body. When the soul has reached
          the most exalted perfection, it is cold, passionless, indifferent;
          then it comes before the Supreme God, passing through the spheres
          guarded by attendant aeons or angels, and to each it protests its
          disengagement. But should any thought or care for mundane matters
          be found lurking in the recesses of the soul, it has to descend
          again, and remain in exile till it has re-absorbed all the life it
          gave, the interest it felt, in such concerns, and then again make
          its essay to reach God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conception
          of Virtues guarding the concentric spheres surrounding the Most
          High is found among the Jews. When Moses went into the presence of
          God to receive the tables of stone, he met first the angel Kemuel,
          chief of the angels of destruction, who would have slain him, but
          Moses pronounced the incommunicable Name, and passed through. Then
          he came to the sphere governed by the angel Hadarniel, and by
          virtue <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg
          295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the Name passed through. Next he came to the sphere over which
          presided the angel Sandalfon, and penetrated by means of the same
          Name. Next he traversed the river of flame, called Riggon, and
          stood before the throne.<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Paul held
          the popular Rabbinic notion of the spheres surrounding the throne
          of God, for he speaks of having been caught up into the third
          heaven.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href=
          "#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a> In
          the apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah there are seven heavens that the
          prophet traverses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rabbinic
          ideas on the spheres were taken probably from the Chaldees, and
          from the same source, perhaps, sprang the conception of the soul
          making her ascension through the angel-guarded spheres, which we
          find in the fragment of the Gospel of St. Philip.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately,
          we have not sufficient of the early literature of the Chaldees and
          Assyrians to be able to say for certain that it was so. But a very
          curious sacred poem has been preserved on the terra-cotta tablets
          of the library of Assurbani-Pal, which exhibits a similar belief as
          prevalent anciently in Assyria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This poem
          represents the descent of Istar into the Immutable Land, the nether
          world, divided into seven circles. The heavenly world of the
          Chaldees was also divided into seven circles, each ruled by a
          planet. The poem therefore exhibits a descent instead of an ascent.
          But there is little reason to doubt that the passage in each case
          would have been analogous. We have no ancient Assyrian account of
          an ascent; we must therefore content ourselves with what we
          have.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Istar descends
          into the lower region, and as she traverses each circle is

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have
          something very similar in the judgment of souls in the Egyptian
          Ritual of the Dead. From Chaldaea or from Egypt the Gnostics who
          used the Gospel of St. Philip drew their doctrine of the soul
          traversing several circles, and arrested by an angel at the gate of
          each.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The soul, a
          divine element, is in the earth combined with the body, a work of
          the Archon. But her aspirations are for that which is above; she
          strives to <span class="tei tei-q">“extirpate his roots.”</span>
          All her <span class="tei tei-q">“scattered members,”</span> her
          thoughts, wishes, impulses, are gathered into one up-tapering
          flame. Then only does she <span class="tei tei-q">“know (God) for
          what He is,”</span> for she has learned the nature of God by
          introspection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, if I
          mistake not, is the meaning of the passage quoted by St.
          Epiphanius. The sect which used such a Gospel must have been
          mystical and ascetic, given to contemplation, and avoiding the
          indulgence of their animal appetites. It was that, probably, of
          Prodicus, strung on the same Pauline thread as the heresies of
          Marcion, Nicolas, Valentine, Marcus, the Ophites, Carpocratians and
          Cainites.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prodicus, on the
          strength of St. Paul's saying that all Christians are a chosen
          generation, a royal priesthood, maintained the sovereignty of every
          man placed under <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
          298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Gospel. But a king is above law, is not bound by law. Therefore
          the Christian is under no bondage of Law, moral or ceremonial. He
          is lord of the Sabbath, above all ordinances. Prodicus made the
          whole worship of God to consist in the inner contemplation of the
          essence of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">External worship
          was not required of the Christian; that had been imposed by the
          Demiurge on the Jews and all under his bondage, till the time of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pauline
          Protestantism of the first two centuries of the Church had not
          exhausted itself in Valentinianism. The fanatics who held free
          justification and emancipation from the Law were ready to run to
          greater lengths than Marcion, Valentine, or even Marcus, was
          prepared to go.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men of ability
          and enthusiasm rose and preached, and galvanized the latent
          Paulinian Gnosticism into temporary life and popularity, and then
          disappeared; the great wave of natural common-sense against which
          they battled returned and overwhelmed their disciples, till another
          heresiarch arose, made another effort to establish permanently a
          religion without morality, again to fail before the
          loudly-expressed disgust of mankind, and the stolid conviction
          inherent in human nature that pure morals and pure religion are and
          must be indissolubly united.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carpocrates was
          one of these revivalists. Everything except faith, all good works,
          all exterior observances, all respect for human laws, were
          indifferent, worse than indifferent, to the Christian: these
          exhibited, where found, an entanglement of the soul in the web
          woven for it by the God of this world, of the Jews, of the Law. The
          body was of the earth, the soul of heaven. Here, again, Carpocrates
          followed and distorted the teaching of St. Paul; the body was under
          the Law, the soul was free. Whatsoever was done in the body did

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With Epiphanes,
          St. Epiphanius couples Isidore, and quotes from his writings
          directions how the Faithful are to obtain disengagement from
          passion, so as to attain union with God. Dean Milman, in his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“History of Christianity,”</span>
          charitably hopes that the licentiousness attributed to these sects
          was deduced by the Fathers from their writings, and was not
          actually practised by them. But the extracts from the books of
          Isidore, Epiphanes and Carpocrates, are sufficient to show that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name=
          "Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> their doctrines were
          subversive of morality, and that, when taught as religious truths
          to men with human passions, they could not fail to produce immoral
          results. An extract from Isidore, preserved by Epiphanius, giving
          instructions to his followers how to conduct themselves, was
          designed to be put in practice. It is impossible even to quote it,
          so revolting is its indecency. In substance it is this: No man can
          approach the Supreme God except when perfectly disengaged from
          earthly passion. This disengagement cannot be attained without
          first satisfying passion; therefore the exhaustion of desire
          consequent on the gratification of passion is the proper
          preparation for prayer.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the same
          licentious class of Antinomians belonged the sect of the
          Antitactes. They also held the distinction between the Supreme God
          and the Demiurge, the God of the Jews,<a id="noteref_506" name=
          "noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class=

          the Law, of the World. The body, the work of the God of creation,
          is evil; it <span class="tei tei-q">“serves the law of sin;”</span>
          nay, it is the very source of sin, and imprisons, degrades, the
          soul entangled in it. Thus the soul serves the law of God, the body
          the law of sin, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of the Demiurge. But the
          Demiurge has imposed on men his law, the Ten Commandments. If the
          soul consents to that law, submits to be in bondage under it, the
          soul passes from the liberty of its ethereal sonship, under the
          dominion of a God at enmity with the Supreme Being. Therefore the
          true Christian must show his adherence to the Omnipotent by
          breaking the laws of the Decalogue,—the more the better.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was religious
          fanaticism capable of descending lower? Apparently it was so. The
          Cainites exhibit Pauline antinomianism in its last, most
          extravagant, most grotesque expression. Their doctrine was the
          extreme development of an idea in itself originally containing an
          element of truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Paul had
          proclaimed the emancipation of the Christian from the Law. Perhaps
          he did not at first sufficiently distinguish between the moral and
          the ceremonial law; he did not, at all events, lay down a broad,
          luminous principle, by which his disciples might distinguish
          between moral obligation to the Decalogue and bondage to the
          ceremonial Law. If both laws were imposed by the same God, to upset
          one was to upset the other. And Paul himself broke a hole in the
          dyke when he opposed the observance of the Sabbath, and instituted
          instead the Lord's-day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through that gap
          rushed the waves, and swept the whole Decalogue
          away.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
          303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some, to rescue
          jeoparded morality, maintained that the Law contained a mixture of
          things good and bad; that the ceremonial law was bad, the moral law
          was good. Some, more happily, asserted that the whole of the Law
          was good, but that part of it was temporary, provisional, intended
          only to be temporary and provisional, a figure of that which was to
          be; and the rest of the Law was permanent, of perpetual
          obligation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ordinances
          of the Mosaic sanctuary were typical. When the fulfilment of the
          types came, the shadows were done away. This was the teaching of
          the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, called forth by the
          disorders which had followed indiscriminating denunciation of the
          Law by the Pauline party.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a large body
          of men could not, or would not, admit this distinction. St. Paul
          had proclaimed the emancipation of the Christian from the Law.
          They, having been Gentiles, had never been under the ceremonial Law
          of Moses. How then could they be set at liberty from it? The only
          freedom they could understand was freedom from the natural law
          written on the fleshy tables of their hearts by the same finger
          that had inscribed the Decalogue on the stones in Sinai. The God of
          the Jews was, indeed, the God of the world. The Old Testament was
          the revelation of his will. Christ had emancipated man from the
          Law. The Law was at enmity to Christ; therefore the Christian was
          at enmity to the Law. The Law was the voice of the God of the Jews;
          therefore the Christian was at enmity to the God of the Jews. Jesus
          was the revelation of the All-good God, the Old Testament the
          revelation of the evil God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Looking at the
          Old Testament from this point of view, the extreme wing of the
          Pauline host, the Cainites, naturally came to regard the Patriarchs
          as being under <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
          304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the protection, the Prophets as being under the inspiration, of the
          God of the Jews, and therefore to hold them in abhorrence, as
          enemies of Christ and the Supreme Deity. Those, on the other hand,
          who were spoken of in the Old Testament as resisting God, punished
          by God, were true prophets, martyrs of the Supreme Deity,
          forerunners of the Gospel. Cain became the type of virtue; Abel, on
          the contrary, of error and perversity. The inhabitants of Sodom and
          Gomorrah were pioneers of Gospel freedom; Corah, Dathan and Abiram,
          martyrs protesting against Mosaism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this singular
          rehabilitation, Judas Iscariot was relieved from the anathema
          weighing upon him. This man, who had sold his Master, was no longer
          regarded as a traitor, but as one who, inspired by the Spirit of
          Wisdom, had been an instrument in the work of redemption. The other
          apostles, narrowed by their prejudices, had opposed the idea of the
          death of Christ, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be it far from
          thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee.”</span><a id="noteref_508"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> But
          Judas, having a clearer vision of the truth, and the necessity for
          the redemption of the world by the death of Christ, took the heroic
          resolution to make that precious sacrifice inevitable. Rising above
          his duties as disciple, in his devotion to the cause of humanity,
          he judged it necessary to prevent the hesitations of Christ, who at
          the last moment seemed to waver; to render inevitable the
          prosecution of his great work. Judas therefore went to the chiefs
          of the synagogue, and covenanted with them to deliver up his Master
          to their will, knowing that by his death the salvation of the world
          could alone be accomplished.<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509"

          mind, but did not freely proclaim it, which God forbid! For such a
          thing were to act in opposition to the law of God, which was spoken
          by Moses, and was borne witness to by our Lord in respect of its

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is instructive to mark how the
          enunciation of the same principles led to the same results after
          the lapse of twelve centuries. The proclamation of free grace,
          emancipation from the Law, justification by faith only, in the
          sixteenth century quickened into being heresies which had lain dead
          through long ages. Bishop Barlow, the Anglican Reformer, and one of
          the compilers of our Prayer-book, thus describes the results of the
          enunciation of these doctrines in Germany and Switzerland, results
          of which he was an eye-witness: <span class="tei tei-q">“There be
          some which hold opinion that all devils and damned souls shall be
          saved at the day of doom. Some of them persuade themselves that
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          serpent which deceived Eve was Christ</span></span>. Some of them
          grant to every man and woman two souls. Some affirm lechery to be
          no sin, and that one may use another man's wife without offence.
          Some take upon them to be soothsayers and prophets of wonderful
          things to come, and have prophesied the day of judgment to be at
          hand, some within three months, some within one month, some within
          six days. Some of them, both men and women, at their congregations

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
